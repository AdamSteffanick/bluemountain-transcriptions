Either<lb facs="P20_TL00007"/>we must unionize the entire crowd, that is, take them into our union<lb facs="P20_TL00008"/>and form new branches ; or we must protest to the city authorities against<lb facs="P20_TL00009"/>the scabbing on our union and require a severe examination for license to<lb facs="P20_TL00010"/>practice the profession, or, we must declare ' open shop ' and go out and<lb facs="P20_TL00011"/>compete with them; relying, of course, on our experience and past training<lb facs="P20_TL00012"/>to out-do them. To my mind, these are the only three ways open to us,<lb facs="P20_TL00013"/>and all have their objections.<lb facs="P20_TL00014"/>" First, if we take the whole crowd into the union we run great risk of<lb facs="P20_TL00015"/>degrading the profession. Professors are begging ! In fact it has come to<lb facs="P20_TL00016"/>such a state that everyone thinks he can be a beggar as though it were an<lb facs="P20_TL00017"/>unskilled trade and not an old, well founded profession. And as though the<lb facs="P20_TL00018"/>profession were without an art. Will we take such men as these into our<lb facs="P20_TL00019"/>ranks ‚Äî men without experience or training ‚Äî just from the streets ?<lb facs="P20_TL00020"/>"No ! We must think of some other plan. If we protest to the city au<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P20_TL00021"/>thorities against scabbing we injure ourselves, at the start, by appealing to<lb facs="P20_TL00022"/>public sympathy; and secondly, it is doubtful whether the authorities would<lb facs="P20_TL00023"/>do anything in this matter, for they surely realize that in these changing times<lb facs="P20_TL00024"/>they themselves may soon be required to seek a new profession. Then my<lb facs="P20_TL00025"/>third plan, namely to declare ' open shop ' is also not very good, for it would<lb facs="P20_TL00026"/>indeed be difficult. It's hard to compete against a teacher or a former pol<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

"<lb facs="P20_TL00029"/>" Does anyone else want the floor ? " called the chairman, and as no<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

I call upon him as we know him to be a tactful and artistic<lb facs="P20_TL00033"/>worker. Perhaps he will explain to us his new method of coping with the<lb facs="P20_TL00034"/>situation.<lb facs="P20_TL00035"/>Jim was a man in shreds, the greater part of his clothing consisting of<lb facs="P20_TL00036"/>cords and colored rags. He stood up very slowly, looked about and began :<lb facs="P20_TL00037"/>" Friends ! Nothing can be solved in our line of work without a good deal<lb facs="P20_TL00038"/>of thought. That is why it is silly to think of taking untrained persons into our<lb facs="P20_TL00039"/>union. We all agree that it is becoming harder and harder to work in the<lb facs="P20_TL00040"/>streets each day. So I said to myself, ' I must think of some plan. ' And<lb facs="P20_TL00041"/>I did ! First, I asked myself, ' Who has money now ? ' And the answer</ab>

The Middle Class, of course, the little<lb facs="P21_TL00004"/>brokers, and stock gamblers ; the exchange merchants and other profiteers.<lb facs="P21_TL00005"/>Therefore I decided to work the offices ; the little rooms in the big buildings.<lb facs="P21_TL00006"/>" I took my time the first few days and made observations. Never hurry !<lb facs="P21_TL00007"/>I would enter an office slowly and quietly and go straight to the clerk and say<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>softly in a tone of ' have pity ' : ' The foxes have holes, and the birds of the<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>air have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head ? '<lb facs="P21_TL00010"/>" The proprietors of these offices were not to be found. And the clerks<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>were so ignorant that they did not understand that I compared them to foxes<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>and birds. Besides this they held a powerful weapon and that was : ' I am<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>sorry, but the boss is not in. ' I had to meet this reply, so I dug up a story<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>and since then have had little difficulty.<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>" It works something like this ; I walk into an office, take off my hat;<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>‚Äî always slowfy, and stand near the door. If I get a fee, well and good ;<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>if not, I wait. A little two-by-four clerk sits at a large desk, and as soon as<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>I enter, pretends to be extremely busy. After a while he glances up and<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>says, ' I am sorry, but the boss is out. ' I do not move and remain as though<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>I did not understand., Again he will look up and say, ' The boss is not in. '<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>And once more, ' What do you want, the boss is not in.

Like<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>most men he had two brains in his head, a big and a little brain. His big brain<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>was very, very fine for he used it often. It was the brain he made his money<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>with. But the little brain was very weak for with this brain he gave charity.<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>I do not say that Moe was a miser, but I do know that his little brain had so<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>little exercise that it became limp and began to rot. This became so serious<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>that it had to be taken from his head by a surgical operation. And as, ac<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>cording to the Hebrew religion, no part of the human body may be thrown away,<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>the little brain was placed in a cigar box and buried in the cemetery. A small<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>tomb-stone no bigger than a cash book marked the spot with the inscription:<lb facs="P21_TL00037"/>' Moe's Little Brain \<lb facs="P21_TL00038"/>" On the day of atonement, according to the Hebrew faith, the Lord walks<lb facs="P21_TL00039"/>among the dead with his large ledger checking the names.

But when<lb facs="P22_TL00003"/>the Lord knocked on the little stone there came no answer. And again<lb facs="P22_TL00004"/>he knocked and there came no answer. He compared the inscription with his<lb facs="P22_TL00005"/>book and called, Moe's Little Brain, are you there ? And with these words<lb facs="P22_TL00006"/>he struck the earth such a blow with his staff that it almost split in two,<lb facs="P22_TL00007"/>as he placed his ear close to the grave.<lb facs="P22_TL00008"/>" And then came a little thin voice from below : ' Please mister, the boss<lb facs="P22_TL00009"/>is not in. '<lb facs="P22_TL00010"/>" This story averages exactly fifty cents. It is a high class entertainment<lb facs="P22_TL00011"/>that I propose to give and naturall.y the fees must be according to the work<lb facs="P22_TL00012"/>and skill of the practitioner. When the offices are exhausted I will find some<lb facs="P22_TL00013"/>other plan ; but I will not go back to the streets with the common scum of the<lb facs="P22_TL00014"/>earth. If a man wants to be a bricklayer he must first know that bricks are<lb facs="P22_TL00015"/>made of clay. If he wants to be a lawyer he must know that documents are<lb facs="P22_TL00016"/>made of words. And if he wants to succeed as a beggar he must realize that<lb facs="P22_TL00017"/>the foundation of the profession is psychology. "<lb facs="P22_TL00018"/>The audience listened attentively to the advice of Jim and after a brief<lb facs="P22_TL00019"/>silence there were many calls for the floor.<lb facs="P22_TL00020"/>" I would just like to ask a question, " said the man with one arm. "In<lb facs="P22_TL00021"/>former years a great deal of our income was derived from the church steps and<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>a good deal more in the name of religion, but now that the free thought move<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>ment is attracting such wide interest, and that anti-religious literature is<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>sold on almost every corner, is not another source of our incomes threatened ?<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>My question is this : Is there any way of deriving profit from the masses who<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>have forsaken the church ? Would it be proper to ask for fees in the name of<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>Voltaire ?<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>" Our comrade Jim " said the man who could dislocate his left hip and<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>thereby make that leg three inches shorter, " has just touched upon the very<lb facs="P22_TL00030"/>subject. I should consider the story he is using now as a mild and inoffensive,<lb facs="P22_TL00031"/>satire. In work of this kind, style is important. In the cloak of art much can<lb facs="P22_TL00032"/>be done. However, his first quotation regarding the foxes and the birds is a<lb facs="P22_TL00033"/>method of which I would not approve as it appears to me to offend our re<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P22_TL00034"/>ligious clients. It is irony ; and when that is used against religion the message<lb facs="P22_TL00035"/>becomes agnostic and therefore offensive to certain people. However, when<lb facs="P22_TL00036"/>a little satire is used it tends to create an impression of non-religion which<lb facs="P22_TL00037"/>is not antagonistic nor offensive. In working the non-religious masses we<lb facs="P22_TL00038"/>should be extremely careful not to offend the others for they are our oldest<lb facs="P22_TL00039"/>and still our best clients.

When we have ceased to blame or praise in accordance with<lb facs="P36_TL00016"/>any standards save those which the particular work of art carries implicit<lb facs="P36_TL00017"/>within itself, may we look for the prompt arrival of a Golden Age, in<lb facs="P36_TL00018"/>which all kinds of art will flourish side by side for the world to choose<lb facs="P36_TL00019"/>from ?<lb facs="P36_TL00020"/>Without, for the moment, taking refuge ‚Äî and possibly a dangerous<lb facs="P36_TL00021"/>refuge ‚Äî in behaviorist or Freudian psychology, one may none the less be<lb facs="P36_TL00022"/>permitted to be somewhat doubtful. This doubt may take two shapes. In<lb facs="P36_TL00023"/>the first place our critics of the new order assure us that what they most desire<lb facs="P36_TL00024"/>to eliminate from aesthetics is dogmatism, which, whether of praise or censure,<lb facs="P36_TL00025"/>is vicious. But just how does our new critic escape this ? Is he so naive as<lb facs="P36_TL00026"/>to suppose that he escapes it merely by removing from his vocabulary the<lb facs="P36_TL00027"/>words 'like' and 'dislike', 'good' and 'bad', 'beautiful' and 'ugly', 'great'<lb facs="P36_TL00028"/>and ' minor' ? He does, of course, no such thing. Suppose he limits<lb facs="P36_TL00029"/>himself to " criticism " of only those works of art with which he finds himself<lb facs="P36_TL00030"/>most in sympathy, limiting himself, again, in such cases, to saying that the<lb facs="P36_TL00031"/>artist " has endeavoured to do such-and-such, and has been successful, or bril<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Will<lb facs="P36_TL00034"/>he any the less be categorizing ? What on earth is he doing if not saying in<lb facs="P36_TL00035"/>so many words "This is the sort of thing I consider important?" And in<lb facs="P36_TL00036"/>ignoring other sorts and excellences of art he is treating them to just the kind of<lb facs="P36_TL00037"/>dogmatism he pretends to despise, with the sole difference that is is not out<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

For the Quarterly to have ignored Keats<lb facs="P36_TL00039"/>would have been essentially to have reviewed him just as dogmatically as he<lb facs="P36_TL00040"/>was reviewed : it would have been tantamount to saying " We do not consider<lb facs="P36_TL00041"/>this poet to be of any importance.

Our " interpretative " critic is, therefore,<lb facs="P37_TL00005"/>seen to be just as dogmatic as any other, but prefers to veil his dogmatism,<lb facs="P37_TL00006"/>to leave it for his reader as a none too imponderable overtone. Our second<lb facs="P37_TL00007"/>doubt takes us further afield. It concerns the function of criticism, and this<lb facs="P37_TL00008"/>doubt is more important; for if we know what the function of criticism is, or can<lb facs="P37_TL00009"/>guess at it, we may then be able to decide better what its nature should be,<lb facs="P37_TL00010"/>and whether it should be candidly or uncandidly dogmatic. What, then, is<lb facs="P37_TL00011"/>the function of criticism ? By far the commonest answer at present would be,<lb facs="P37_TL00012"/>no doubt, that criticism should act as mediator between artist and audience :<lb facs="P37_TL00013"/>that it should explain. And that this purpose in criticism always has been,<lb facs="P37_TL00014"/>is, and perhaps always will be among the most important of its characteristics<lb facs="P37_TL00015"/>can hardly be doubted. We might even go further and say that it is the most<lb facs="P37_TL00016"/>ideal of its characteristics. It would be an ideal world, certainly, in which<lb facs="P37_TL00017"/>the poet's new book should be greeted by a thousand reviews in none of which<lb facs="P37_TL00018"/>would be a single slip of blame or praise, but only a studious effort to make<lb facs="P37_TL00019"/>transparent the poet's meaning. It would in fact have to be an ideal world ‚Äî a<lb facs="P37_TL00020"/>world in which every poet wrote poetry worth reading ; for with the literary<lb facs="P37_TL00021"/>journals filled with analyses and interpretations, week after week, and no indi<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P37_TL00022"/>cations anywhere of choice, one would perhaps otherwise waste a great deal<lb facs="P37_TL00023"/>of time in search of what one liked, and one would be certain to miss many<lb facs="P37_TL00024"/>a treasure. Yes, it would have to be an ideal world, or a world in which<lb facs="P37_TL00025"/>literature was a thing of the past. If literature were no longer a living<lb facs="P37_TL00026"/>thing, if all the evidence, so to speak, were "in ", then criticism might<lb facs="P37_TL00027"/>become an exact science. Animosities and jealousies would no longer be<lb facs="P37_TL00028"/>engaged, it would cease to be important from the point of view of poet x<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Well, which method in criticism is<lb facs="P39_TL00020"/>more stimulating to art, which will tend to provoke and release the greater<lb facs="P39_TL00021"/>number of artistic energies ? A question to which the answer is by no means<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>a foregone conclusion, but it seems to me that the answer whould rather be<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>in favor of the dogmatist, whose opinions are vividly outspoken, than of the<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>interpreter, whose opinions are patiently concealed.

                                    <lb facs="P48_TL00003"/>During the course of some psychological investigations I was making, I<lb facs="P48_TL00004"/>found it necessary to visit an insane asylum near New York. The building was<lb facs="P48_TL00005"/>no more than an ill-smelling barracks, very desolate : but the young interne,<lb facs="P48_TL00006"/>who guided me through the place, finally took me to a series of private rooms,<lb facs="P48_TL00007"/>which were homelike and pleasant and had windows facing the fields and the<lb facs="P48_TL00008"/>hills. He told me by the way that I must above all things see Dr. Farraday.<lb facs="P48_TL00009"/>Dr. Farraday, he explained, knew a great deal about the human soul: so much<lb facs="P48_TL00010"/>so that the young doctors often consulted him about puzzling and unusual<lb facs="P48_TL00011"/>cases.<lb facs="P48_TL00012"/>" He is the most interesting man here, " he told me.<lb facs="P48_TL00013"/>" And what is he suffering from ? " I asked.<lb facs="P48_TL00014"/>He smiled. " You'll have to get his own diagnosis, "he said. " Betweeen<lb facs="P48_TL00015"/>you and me, I think he has a high regard for our free board and lodging. He<lb facs="P48_TL00016"/>has the sort of insanity of the hobo, of the I-Won't-Works. But he came to it<lb facs="P48_TL00017"/>too late in life to make freight cars and hay-lofts at all attractive. He was<lb facs="P48_TL00018"/>too settled down to wander the world, and too ‚Äî well, insane to work. "<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>" Well ! " I laughed, " I daresay there are many like him ‚Äî only they are<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>quartered on relatives, or wives, or friends. . . In ancient days that form of<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>insanity was highly honorable. It is, isn't it, the insanity of the artist ?<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>His answer was to knock at a door, and a deep and rather pleasing voice<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>cried, " Come in. " So we went in.<lb facs="P48_TL00024"/>The light flooded brightly through the tall wide window, so that at first<lb facs="P48_TL00025"/>I only saw a dark bulk coming toward us. But I noticed the walls hung with<lb facs="P48_TL00026"/>many strange and brilliant drawings, all of a symbolical nature, mythic animals<lb facs="P48_TL00027"/>and gods, stars and moons, and landscapes that never were. When I was through<lb facs="P48_TL00028"/>blinking, and had my man on the darker side of me, I saw him quite plainly.<lb facs="P48_TL00029"/>He was rather bulky and large, swarthy, and something about his face resembling<lb facs="P48_TL00030"/>the face of a turtle.<lb facs="P48_TL00031"/>His manner was very courteous, but a little absent.

He rubbed his chin, gazed about abstractedly,<lb facs="P49_TL00011"/>swung his leg back and forth in a too obvious rhythm. And at last he spoke<lb facs="P49_TL00012"/>in a voice which did not seem his at all ‚Äî a voice which appeared to me to belong<lb facs="P49_TL00013"/>to some other person.

"It gets us nowhere.<lb facs="P49_TL00016"/>Intellect ! science ! theor}*! brain-spinning ! Young man, that is our modern<lb facs="P49_TL00017"/>devil. Kill him .. . strangle him out of your soul.

"<lb facs="P49_TL00020"/>For a moment I thought I was coming to psychic fisticuffs with him ; but<lb facs="P49_TL00021"/>I reflected, and at once swallowed my pride.<lb facs="P49_TL00022"/>" I see, " I said, looking him in the eyes, " knew this modern Devil<lb facs="P49_TL00023"/>very well ; perhaps intimately. "<lb facs="P49_TL00024"/>He glanced at me.<lb facs="P49_TL00025"/>"You sit there, "he cried, " a bit of ice yourself. I feel no warmth from<lb facs="P49_TL00026"/>you ; I am not a human being to you, but just another case. I<lb facs="P49_TL00027"/>look for Christ and find a Devil.

"<lb facs="P50_TL00021"/>" I have always believed in them, " he said in his strange voice again, " but<lb facs="P50_TL00022"/>I laughed at them. The great Dr. Farraday laughed at the gods.

"<lb facs="P50_TL00025"/>We sat in silence, smoking, and now and then I felt him trying to pierce<lb facs="P50_TL00026"/>me with a look.

                                    <lb facs="P51_TL00003"/>I must tell you a little about his childhood . . . not much ... it is not very im<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P51_TL00004"/>portant. Trudo was a sensitive child ; he couldn't compete with the boys :<lb facs="P51_TL00005"/>he was a coward and a stay-at-home. He felt everything so intensely that<lb facs="P51_TL00006"/>he suffered incessantly. He could not fight, he could not play ball. And his<lb facs="P51_TL00007"/>father, whom he worshipped, died. And his mother was practical and embit<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P51_TL00008"/>tered by her .struggles and her poverty. Trudo felt he was a worm. Yes, he<lb facs="P51_TL00009"/>was vermin. Until he made a discovery ... If you couldn't beat others with<lb facs="P51_TL00010"/>your fists or your skill or your leadership, you could beat them with your mind.<lb facs="P51_TL00011"/>And that was the beginning of the end for Trudo . . .<lb facs="P51_TL00012"/>"He resolutely killed all his feelings. It can be done, you know. You<lb facs="P51_TL00013"/>become like the snail. His body is soft and fragile : but he draws it into his<lb facs="P51_TL00014"/>shell when there is danger of attack. This is what Trudo did. And for the rest,<lb facs="P51_TL00015"/>he studied. He became a physician and a man of research. He developed his<lb facs="P51_TL00016"/>intellect in a truly marvellous way. And he rose, and was well on the path<lb facs="P51_TL00017"/>toward greatness.<lb facs="P51_TL00018"/>" I won't bore you with the details. They are the same for everyone who<lb facs="P51_TL00019"/>succeeds. Think of your own successes. Merely imagine Trudo at the top of<lb facs="P51_TL00020"/>his profession, living in a very fine house near Central Park on a chaste side street.<lb facs="P51_TL00021"/>Respectability, luxury, the waiting room with old masters on the wall, the tiled<lb facs="P51_TL00022"/>and shining laboratory, the cushioned library, and so on, and so on .. . It<lb facs="P51_TL00023"/>is not important, is it ?<lb facs="P51_TL00024"/>" I pause a moment to speak of his wife. She was a very fine woman,<lb facs="P51_TL00025"/>doubtless. Of one of the old New York families. If I mentioned the name,<lb facs="P51_TL00026"/>you'd know all about it, I'm sure. And she was religious, in a way, though her<lb facs="P51_TL00027"/>god was rather a crude one, a sort of hybrid, not of the sphinx variety exactly,<lb facs="P51_TL00028"/>but a good respectable American god. lam not cynical about it either. That<lb facs="P51_TL00029"/>god has given us much of America .. . Let me describe him in a word, a line :<lb facs="P51_TL00030"/>He was a puritan who believed in hard work, righteousness and business. And<lb facs="P51_TL00031"/>he believed in kindness and purity. You see my wife, don't you ? She wanted<lb facs="P51_TL00032"/>me to be honest and upright, respectable and wealthy, and at the same time<lb facs="P51_TL00033"/>lowly and obedient, ‚Äî down on my knees to her deity .. . She found me then<lb facs="P51_TL00034"/>an anomaly : I was honest, I was wealthy, I was upright ; but I was proud and<lb facs="P51_TL00035"/>vain and consumed in myself. I had no love in my heart. You know there<lb facs="P51_TL00036"/>was John Brown to prove that a puritan can love like a blast of fire. But<lb facs="P51_TL00037"/>also, as you know, a puritan can be a peak of ice.<lb facs="P51_TL00038"/>" Now I must tell you a great joke. My patients thought me a second Jesus.<lb facs="P51_TL00039"/>Actually. And why ? Because I was remarkably intuitive. I could pierce<lb facs="P51_TL00040"/>direct into their souls, and so I knew just what to say and to do to make them<lb facs="P51_TL00041"/>feel I was in full sympathy with them. Is there anything more devilish than<lb facs="P51_TL00042"/>that ? I ask you. Think. To use the art of love to serve merely one's ambi-</ab>

Good old American bluff, isn't it ? "<lb facs="P52_TL00004"/>He paused, and took a puff on his cigar. It was as if he had forgotten my<lb facs="P52_TL00005"/>presence. Indeed he did not seem to realize that he had dropped speaking of<lb facs="P52_TL00006"/>' Trudo ' and was speaking directly of himself, in the first person.<lb facs="P52_TL00007"/>Then he went on, his voice growing warm and poignant.<lb facs="P52_TL00008"/>"My wife warned me, often. She said I had slain my soul, and was headed<lb facs="P52_TL00009"/>for a great crash. She pointed out how many of our great business-men make<lb facs="P52_TL00010"/>forced marches on success and are killed or driven insane or into a sanitarium<lb facs="P52_TL00011"/>before they are fifty. I agreed with her. But what could Ido ? The greatest<lb facs="P52_TL00012"/>tragedy of my life was the fact that it was a comedy. I knew all the facts, but<lb facs="P52_TL00013"/>I didn't care a snap of my fingers. I could not feel the tragedy. I was perfectly<lb facs="P52_TL00014"/>happy on the ice ‚Äî that is, if you can call it happy. Perhaps, to put it more<lb facs="P52_TL00015"/>honestly, I was neither glad nor sad, but busy, alert and keen.<lb facs="P52_TL00016"/>" Then the symptoms came. I will not enter into the details. Palpitation<lb facs="P52_TL00017"/>of the heart, for instance ‚Äî a very bad symptom, as you know. You see,<lb facs="P52_TL00018"/>I had no heart : so it was just there that the gods began to make mischief.<lb facs="P52_TL00019"/>Ah, yes, I knew then that the gods I had laughed at were preparing a little<lb facs="P52_TL00020"/>doomsday for me. Man does not live by intellect alone. If thou hast two<lb facs="P52_TL00021"/>loaves of bread, sell one, and buy hyacinths for thy soul. Lord ! I said those<lb facs="P52_TL00022"/>very words to myself at the time. But of what avail ?<lb facs="P52_TL00023"/>" Obviously there was nothing I could do ‚Äî except one thing. I could<lb facs="P52_TL00024"/>put away Mammon ‚Äî I could give up my practice, my fine house, my scientific<lb facs="P52_TL00025"/>researches. But what modern successful man can do it ? It was exactly<lb facs="P52_TL00026"/>like the rich young man who went to Jesus. And Jesus asked him if he could<lb facs="P52_TL00027"/>give up his wealth: leave all, and follow. And the young man could not. That<lb facs="P52_TL00028"/>was I.<lb facs="P52_TL00029"/>" No. My pride and revolt increase, if anything. And I even became cold<lb facs="P52_TL00030"/>toward my wife. And this killed her. I looked on her dead face, and not even<lb facs="P52_TL00031"/>then could I break through the ice, and drop one poor tear of pity or self-pity.<lb facs="P52_TL00032"/>"You see, I was utterly lost. And now with my wife dead, and no children,<lb facs="P52_TL00033"/>and no true friends, you might have thought that it would be easy to let go of<lb facs="P52_TL00034"/>the power of the world.

                                    <lb facs="P52_TL00035"/>tion, that was all. I was going to do a great bit of scientific writing. . .<lb facs="P52_TL00036"/>" Then the lightning struck me. Oh, it was so simple, so simple. I was<lb facs="P52_TL00037"/>walking one night on a side-street on the lower west side. And a prostitute<lb facs="P52_TL00038"/>accosted me. I had a sudden burning curiosity. I was curious about the<lb facs="P52_TL00039"/>psychology of prostitution. I would go with this woman, and study her. I<lb facs="P52_TL00040"/>had no desire. I was a puritan. I did not want to touch her. Ugh! as a<lb facs="P52_TL00041"/>physician I knew too much about the diseases of vice , . .</ab>

And in the gaslight I saw her : a very<lb facs="P53_TL00004"/>thin woman, a little tall, and perhaps tubercular. Shining eyes and glowing<lb facs="P53_TL00005"/>cheeks. And she was very poor.

I began questioning her, when suddenly<lb facs="P53_TL00008"/>she burst out on me :<lb facs="P53_TL00009"/>" ' But you are not a human being. You are terrible. I feel as if the Devil<lb facs="P53_TL00010"/>himself were in this room. '<lb facs="P53_TL00011"/>" I was startled. I asked her :<lb facs="P53_TL00012"/>" ' Who are you ? Where do you come from ? '<lb facs="P53_TL00013"/>"' I am a Russian, ' she said, ' and a Jewess. My name is Iyosha. '<lb facs="P53_TL00014"/>" ' But are not you in league with the Devil also ?

You<lb facs="P53_TL00017"/>are a lost soul. '<lb facs="P53_TL00018"/>" ' Yes, ' I admitted in my honest way, 'I am lost. What's to be done<lb facs="P53_TL00019"/>about it ? '<lb facs="P53_TL00020"/>" ' You know you are lost, ' she cried, ' and yet ask me that ? Oh, this is<lb facs="P53_TL00021"/>terrible. This is the eternal damnation they talk about. .. '<lb facs="P53_TL00022"/>" ' That doesn't help me, ' I said. 112 Talk has never helped me. I can<lb facs="P53_TL00023"/>talk myself. '<lb facs="P53_TL00024"/>She stared at me, and leaned toward me.<lb facs="P53_TL00025"/>" ' You are right. Only an infinite love could help you. '<lb facs="P53_TL00026"/>" That was the way we talked.

                                    <lb facs="P53_TL00027"/>tioner and had a great desire to tell her about myself. I told everything, just<lb facs="P53_TL00028"/>as I have told you. It was amazing enough :an ignorant sick woman of the<lb facs="P53_TL00029"/>gutter, one whose body was common merchandise, and who had no life of her<lb facs="P53_TL00030"/>own, and I, the learned scientist, the respectable and wealthy doctor.<lb facs="P53_TL00031"/>" Three times I went to see her. And at the third the lightning passed<lb facs="P53_TL00032"/>through me. She was weeping when I entered and would not rise from the<lb facs="P53_TL00033"/>bed. Her face was buried in her hands.<lb facs="P53_TL00034"/>" ' Why are you crying, Losha ? ' I asked.<lb facs="P53_TL00035"/>"' I weep, ' she said, ' because you are to be pitied more than I am. We<lb facs="P53_TL00036"/>are both prostitutes. But the Devil in me is a god, and you have no god. '<lb facs="P53_TL00037"/>" I stood, silent, but quite calm. Then she rose slowly and flung her arms<lb facs="P53_TL00038"/>about my neck. I had not expected it. She whispered passionately :<lb facs="P53_TL00039"/>"' I love you. I love you. I love you.

And first<lb facs="P54_TL00004"/>I felt a burning steal through my body, a hot and primal fire, the smoky breath<lb facs="P54_TL00005"/>of hell itself, and for the first time I could remember I had the horrible cannibal<lb facs="P54_TL00006"/>lust to tear a human body limb from limb. But while I was convulsed with<lb facs="P54_TL00007"/>this, something strangely other came up and mingled with the lust. It was as<lb facs="P54_TL00008"/>if I saw the Christ.

I called ' the goddess ' and prostrated<lb facs="P54_TL00017"/>myself before her. Then I shrieked aloud for the torture and agony and had<lb facs="P54_TL00018"/>something very like a fit of epilepsy.<lb facs="P54_TL00019"/>" She was terrified. She finally put me to bed, and soothed me. She<lb facs="P54_TL00020"/>nursed me tenderly. I would lie quescient for hours ,in a fever. Then the spell<lb facs="P54_TL00021"/>was 011 me.

He had<lb facs="P58_TL00006"/>not, as he had once hoped he might, " burst upon the world " as a new figure<lb facs="P58_TL00007"/>in letters. He could look back upon many hours both of impatience and despair.<lb facs="P58_TL00008"/>He had had at first to work under difficulties ; to write novels and stories in<lb facs="P58_TL00009"/>the intervals of the necessary employment that had provided him with the means<lb facs="P58_TL00010"/>of life. Later, also, he had not dared to do quite his best work. He had had<lb facs="P58_TL00011"/>to keep his eye on the requirements of editors and publishers. But now. . .<lb facs="P58_TL00012"/>He found retrospect pleasant on this particular afternoon. There had<lb facs="P58_TL00013"/>been no special climax to exhilarate him, but the more important reviews of<lb facs="P58_TL00014"/>his last book had, as it were, suddenly lifted ; treating him for the first time as<lb facs="P58_TL00015"/>a novelist of recognised standing ; his publishers had sent him a friendly and very<lb facs="P58_TL00016"/>encouraging report of his sales, and mentioned that they were, also, selling now<lb facs="P58_TL00017"/>many of his earlier books ; he had had well-paid commissions for short stories ;<lb facs="P58_TL00018"/>and he had received a very good offer for the serialisation of his next novel, al<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Also, he had at last<lb facs="P58_TL00020"/>got settled into his new and altogether delightful house, a house that had an<lb facs="P58_TL00021"/>effect of dignity and leisure ; a house to which he would be proud to invite his<lb facs="P58_TL00022"/>many friends and acquaintances in the world of letters. And all these successes<lb facs="P58_TL00023"/>taken together and added to the fact that it was a glorious afternoon, had roused<lb facs="P58_TL00024"/>him during his solitary walk, to a warm and comforting sense of achievement,<lb facs="P58_TL00025"/>to the feeling that he had after all his struggles definitely and happily arrived.<lb facs="P58_TL00026"/>And he was only thirty-nine.

The<lb facs="P62_TL00006"/>exigencies of the poetical form involve so much discipline. I shall come to<lb facs="P62_TL00007"/>that, in time ; at present I prefer the freedoms of prose. "<lb facs="P62_TL00008"/>" But good prose, surely ..." Bertram began.<lb facs="P62_TL00009"/>Ronald waved that aside. "Oh ! I know ; I know , " he said. " But<lb facs="P62_TL00010"/>it happens that my thoughts fall more naturally into prose. "<lb facs="P62_TL00011"/>" Would you let me see your ‚Äî your essay is it ? ‚Äî or whatever you've<lb facs="P62_TL00012"/>written ? " Bertram asked.<lb facs="P62_TL00013"/>" I would have, like a shot if I'd got it, " Ronald said. " I don't know<lb facs="P62_TL00014"/>how to describe it exactly. It was a kind of fantasy, half allegory and half<lb facs="P62_TL00015"/>romance. Rather good in parts, but it's just as well I destroyed it. "<lb facs="P62_TL00016"/>" You destroyed it ? " gasped Bertram, who had treasured his every line.<lb facs="P62_TL00017"/>" That was what the row was about and why I was blubbing just now,"<lb facs="P62_TL00018"/>Ronald explained. " Herondale came down last night and after lunch to-day,<lb facs="P62_TL00019"/>we had a first-class row. Holy Sinners ! What a row it was ! He wouldn't<lb facs="P62_TL00020"/>give way an inch when I said I wanted to chuck everything and write. He<lb facs="P62_TL00021"/>had read my thing over night and said it ' showed promise' or some rot of that<lb facs="P62_TL00022"/>kind. It was then I tore it up and cursed him and came out here. I was onfy<lb facs="P62_TL00023"/>blubbing because I'd lost my temper. I work it off that way. I'm like that. "<lb facs="P62_TL00024"/>" You can re-write it, I suppose, " Bertram put in.<lb facs="P62_TL00025"/>" I could but I shan't, " Ronald said. " I've got a better idea, I want to<lb facs="P62_TL00026"/>get down. The other was only the sort of thing one begins with Just as<lb facs="P62_TL00027"/>well that it's out of the way. "<lb facs="P62_TL00028"/>" I wish I'd seen it all the same, " Bertram murmured.<lb facs="P62_TL00029"/>" Yes, it's a pity, especially if you're going to help me, " Ronald agreed.<lb facs="P62_TL00030"/>" But I'll get this other thing going pretty soon and then I'll read it to you.<lb facs="P62_TL00031"/>I expect you'll be a fairly decent judge even though you are on a different<lb facs="P62_TL00032"/>line yourself. "<lb facs="P62_TL00033"/>Bertram blushed faintly, remembering his companion's first greeting.<lb facs="P62_TL00034"/>"Ah ! yes, by the way, " he said, " you don't ‚Äî er ‚Äî care for my books, I<lb facs="P62_TL00035"/>infer.

He had always known it was true, and had never dared to face<lb facs="P63_TL00004"/>the fact. He had no passion, no creative force, no real temperament. He<lb facs="P63_TL00005"/>was a patient and able craftsman, that was all.<lb facs="P63_TL00006"/>" You're very frank, " was all he said, but he said it humbly.<lb facs="P63_TL00007"/>Ronald looked at him with a sudden touch of contrition. "It was rotten<lb facs="P63_TL00008"/>of me to say that, "he admitted. " Just after you'd promised to help me,<lb facs="P63_TL00009"/>too. I shall have to cure myself of this beastly habit of saying whatever I<lb facs="P63_TL00010"/>think. "<lb facs="P63_TL00011"/>" No, no, " Bertram said. " Not with me, anyway. That's one of your<lb facs="P63_TL00012"/>gifts. It will get you into all sorts of trouble, but it's ‚Äî it's a part of your<lb facs="P63_TL00013"/>genius. "<lb facs="P63_TL00014"/>Ronald instantly forgot his apology. " How can you tell I've got genius, "<lb facs="P63_TL00015"/>he said ; " when you've never seen a word that I've written ? "<lb facs="P63_TL00016"/>" Won't you, at least, give me credit for some intuition ? " Bertram<lb facs="P63_TL00017"/>asked. " Even if you can't find the evidence of it in my novels ?<lb facs="P63_TL00018"/>Ronald did not seem to hear that pathetic speech. He was staring out in<lb facs="P63_TL00019"/>front of him, and apparently regardless of Bertram's presence. " I suppose<lb facs="P63_TL00020"/>after all, " he said " that pretty nearly anyone except Herondale and his sort<lb facs="P63_TL00021"/>would know at once that I am a genius. That was what they really meant<lb facs="P63_TL00022"/>at Marlborough, when they said I was incorrigible. "<lb facs="P63_TL00023"/>He jumped to his feet with an air of relief as he continued, "I'm glad<lb facs="P63_TL00024"/>I met you. It has helped me to clear my ideas a bit ; and if Ido quarrel finally<lb facs="P63_TL00025"/>with Herondale I could come to you until I got launched. "<lb facs="P63_TL00026"/>" Certainly you might if you would care to, " Bertram agreed meekly.<lb facs="P63_TL00027"/>" But wouldn't it be better for you in every way if I were able to persuade<lb facs="P63_TL00028"/>Lord Herondale that it is his duty to let you express yourself in your own<lb facs="P63_TL00029"/>way ? "<lb facs="P63_TL00030"/>Ronald pursed his mouth and regarded Bertram thoughtfully. "My dear<lb facs="P63_TL00031"/>man, you'd have no earthly, " he said.<lb facs="P63_TL00032"/>Just for a moment, however, some faint reflection of his dream had returned<lb facs="P63_TL00033"/>to Bertram.

Yet before he reached home, he was in the<lb facs="P64_TL00013"/>air again. For illumination came to him suddenly, blindingly. He saw<lb facs="P64_TL00014"/>where he had failed. Those characters of his that had no " red blood in them "<lb facs="P64_TL00015"/>were echoes of himse'f. They had been too gentle, too considerate in their<lb facs="P64_TL00016"/>dealings with their fellowmen. Now, he had recognised for the first time in<lb facs="P64_TL00017"/>his life the ruthless egotism of genius. He could never imitate that in his life,<lb facs="P64_TL00018"/>but, by Heaven, he could portray it in a novel. The book, indeed, was already<lb facs="P64_TL00019"/>beginning to unfold itself in his mind vivid and enthralling. It would be his<lb facs="P64_TL00020"/>masterpiece.

The lovers<lb facs="P83_TL00025"/>reached the summit of a bluff, and by a precarious path descended to a beach<lb facs="P83_TL00026"/>where white sand went in and out of walls of boulders.<lb facs="P83_TL00027"/>" The ruins of forgotten rites, " observed Fabrizia, pausing with interest<lb facs="P83_TL00028"/>and yet with apprenhension. " Shall we be happy among them in this crushing<lb facs="P83_TL00029"/>presence of sea and sky ? "<lb facs="P83_TL00030"/>" These walls are votive tablets, " explained Agostino, " where, in loyalty<lb facs="P83_TL00031"/>to a fabled goddess of the sea, men and maids have wreathed together their in<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

It was an omen.<lb facs="P84_TL00020"/>They went down together to the blue ; and the waves approached them,<lb facs="P84_TL00021"/>crested and lustrous. But the waves seemed to Fabrizia like promising young<lb facs="P84_TL00022"/>business men and other naturalists, who one after another filed petitions in<lb facs="P84_TL00023"/>spiritual bankruptcy.
