I have doubtless inserted many<lb facs="P19_TL00025"/>barbs into your tender minds. These barbs will rankle, until<lb facs="P19_TL00026"/>some day, when you are older, you will understand. At that<lb facs="P19_TL00027"/>time it might aid you to remember that man possesses a species of<lb facs="P19_TL00028"/>seed which, if properly laid within the soul of woman, can<lb facs="P19_TL00029"/>frequently result in her drinking poison, or falling from a bridge.<lb facs="P19_TL00030"/>.... Now, go, little sealed things, little unplumbed possibilities,<lb facs="P19_TL00031"/>little fields unplowed. Ride off in a carriage tight shut, where no<lb facs="P19_TL00032"/>ray of sunlight can enter.<lb facs="P19_TL00033"/>(They go, after each has received a kiss and a gift of money<lb facs="P19_TL00034"/>from the Prince.)<lb facs="P19_TL00035"/>Prince Llan (to himself) : There, how gently he sent them off. And<lb facs="P19_TL00036"/>he might just as readily have driven them with clubs. He bowed<lb facs="P19_TL00037"/>them away as virgins, instead of beating them as bitches. That<lb facs="P19_TL00038"/>is better, since more proper to a parting.<lb facs="P19_TL00039"/>( They went, and the Prince watched them mould together into a<lb facs="P19_TL00040"/>spot on the horizon.)</ab>

                                       <lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>ous forms he has created seem so intangible. To many of those<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>who do not understand this fact, this translation of one art into the<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>technic of another, the poems of E. E.

The spatial<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>organization of color has become the durational organization of<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>words, the technical problem that of tempo. Words, like planes in<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>abstract painting, function not as units in a logical structure, but as<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>units functioning in a vital and organic structure of time.

Their<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>beauty is that of all swift things seen at rest.<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>In his best work this speed is evident; there exists in them an<lb facs="P29_TL00033"/>organized direction toward which each verbal unit functions at its<lb facs="P29_TL00034"/>highest velocity. Cummings seldom attempts to achieve momentum<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>through the utilization of mass, the violent and often painful impact<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>of his poems is the active manifestation of speed; their formal beauty<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>has that quality common to racing cars, aeroplanes, and to those<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>birds surviving because of their swift wings.<lb facs="P29_TL00039"/>But it is this speed, this sudden impact of his poems which turns<lb facs="P29_TL00040"/>so many people against them. Men do not like to be knocked down,<lb facs="P29_TL00041"/>particularly by some quality they admire.
