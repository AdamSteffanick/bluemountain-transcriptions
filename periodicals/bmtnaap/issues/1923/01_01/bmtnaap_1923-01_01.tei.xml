Wurtelbach had avoided<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>the cow-flops, as well as the eyes of the girls. What if he were to eat<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>a cow-flop; Christ, what a stir!

The bull! . . .<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>Wurtelbach promptly advanced, while the girls crawled back under the<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>barbed wire nervously. The brute kicked up clods of grass and dirt over<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>his swaying rump. Wurtelbach collected rocks with an inward emphasis.<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>Then he began throwing, until one rock hit the bull on a protruding shoulder<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>bone. The bull retreated back among the trees, vibrating and sending little<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>pebbles rolling down the hill. Wurtelbach continued to throw, thus assuring<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>safe conduct for his women.<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>Then came half a mile of tangle, where the trail was nearly lost,<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>until it broke into full view of the mountains. They rolled away blue-black,<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>like the faithful backs of elephants. From across the valley they got the<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>broadside of Craggy. Every one waited for Anne, and when she arrived<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>she was chagrined at being waited for. You could plunge words deep into<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>Anne. Some little half-uttered sentence with the man-and-woman about<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>it . . . you could let it drop and feel sure that it would be picked up. Anne<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>was like a deep pool: you could throw in a pebble . . . there would be<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>a little ripple . . . and then the pebble would lie there. When Anne went<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>into her room at night and shut the door, you felt that it was being shut<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>with sullenness. Anne was not good-looking; it was generally agreed that<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>she would never marry.<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>When they reached the Flats, Wurtelbach sneaked away to observe<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>the ridges.

When he opened<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>them again, he picked one little white roof five miles down the valley. Then<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>he sailed from here to there in a bee-line, and among the ridges. The thin,<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>dead air made him feel the pulse-beat in his ears.

(Five hundred crab meat salads were<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>removed simultaneously, and five hundred roasted second joints of capon<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>were brought in their place.)

This Englishman,<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>while visiting his American cousin in California, being greatly impressed<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>by the extended cultivation which was going on, had asked.

And the American<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>had answered. ffOh, we can what we can, and what we can't can, we can."<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>Now the Englishman was inordinately tickled with this, but later, while<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>trying to repeat it back home, he blundered with characteristic stupidity,<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>ffoh, we can what we cawn, and what we cawn't can we put up in tins."<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>Table 36 laughed the fitting amount, and a dealer from a small town<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>outside of Buffalo told one about a rather fast woman; and what is more,<lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>he followed it with one about a woman's parts.<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>Table 36 was now in a pleasant frame of mind, and when the band<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>jazzed again, everybody joined in the chorus. The two men came out —<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>fairies probably — and sang something or other. The five hundred gentlemen<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>assembled did not listen. The two fairies melted away, and forty women<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>appeared, which explains why certain tables were upset in the yowling<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>rush toward the centre of the floor.

But no one<lb facs="P13_TL00030"/>ever thought to make her stop because of it. She stoned the<lb facs="P13_TL00031"/>cows, and beat her dog, and fought the other children . . .

Karintha<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>had seen or heard, perhaps she had felt her parents loving. One<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>could but imitate one's parents, for to follow them was the way<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>of God. She played home' with a small boy who was not afraid<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>to do her bidding. That started the whole thing.

She has contempt for them.<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>Karintha is a woman. Young men run stills to make her money.<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>Young men gamble to make her money. Young men go to the<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>large cities and run on the road. Young men go away to college.<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>They all want to bring her money. These are the young men who<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>thought that all they had to do was to count time. But Karintha<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>is a woman, and she has had a child. A child fell out of her<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>womb onto a bed of pine-needles in the forest. Pine-needles are<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>smooth and sweet.

In the sixteenth century the Spaniards, marching north<lb facs="P16_TL00030"/>from Peru to Mexico, found their ruined cities inhabited by an alien and inferior race<lb facs="P16_TL00031"/>of Indians.

                                    <lb facs="P21_TL00004"/>There was consternation in the house of Price Conover. It was not<lb facs="P21_TL00005"/>mingled with grief, nor with sympathy; it was pure consternation which<lb facs="P21_TL00006"/>contains the same elements as fear but in different proportions, and under<lb facs="P21_TL00007"/>the influence of this emotion some of the guests began to pack their bags<lb facs="P21_TL00008"/>for departure to the city. The conduct of these few, for a certain embarrassed<lb facs="P21_TL00009"/>decorum restrained the greater number, recoiled upon their heads in the<lb facs="P21_TL00010"/>form of petulant comment, so that they sullenly stayed out the day only to<lb facs="P21_TL00011"/>make a weak gesture of defiance to the prevailing opinion by tiptoeing out<lb facs="P21_TL00012"/>during the night to catch the early morning train which took the farmer's<lb facs="P21_TL00013"/>milk into New York. In the overheated car, where gas-lamps mingled<lb facs="P21_TL00014"/>sickly yellow rays with the grey frosty dawn, they relaxed, grumbling to<lb facs="P21_TL00015"/>one another their relief as the train took them farther and farther from<lb facs="P21_TL00016"/>the shrill ravings and terrified screams of young Price Conover jr., whose<lb facs="P21_TL00017"/>wedding at St. Peter's at high noon a certain unknown boot-legger had<lb facs="P21_TL00018"/>unwittingly prevented.<lb facs="P21_TL00019"/>The groom-to-be was not popular with his father's guests. They had<lb facs="P21_TL00020"/>come to the three day party with the same impersonal alacrity with which<lb facs="P21_TL00021"/>they would have followed a stranger up an alley had he crooked a finger,<lb facs="P21_TL00022"/>winked one eye, and lightly patted his hip-pocket. The difference was that<lb facs="P21_TL00023"/>everything in the elder Conover's cellar had been sealed in the days when<lb facs="P21_TL00024"/>the government bond meant something.<lb facs="P21_TL00025"/>For three days the lights were never switched off, night or day. The<lb facs="P21_TL00026"/>men, all hardy veterans of many a battle with the brains of Kentucky and<lb facs="P21_TL00027"/>the brawn of Scotland, drank until they fell about the billiard and poker<lb facs="P21_TL00028"/>tables, and slept where they fell. Later in the day they stumbled up to beds,<lb facs="P21_TL00029"/>or were dragged there by servants who, callous as they were, grew sick of<lb facs="P21_TL00030"/>the job; but no one ever thought or cared to press a button that would<lb facs="P21_TL00031"/>quench the blazing lights. In the dining room the radiance was strained<lb facs="P21_TL00032"/>through grey strata of cigar smoke; in the bedrooms the lamps heated the<lb facs="P21_TL00033"/>stale air while men slept like the dead. By night the country folk on their<lb facs="P21_TL00034"/>way home from town pointed to the yellow edges of light along the margins<lb facs="P21_TL00035"/>ol the heavy window draperies, and made moral observations on the ways<lb facs="P21_TL00036"/>of the rich; by day the house appeared deserted except as pasty-faced,</ab>

In his high-posted, oak-pannelled library,<lb facs="P22_TL00022"/>with beads of sweat rolling down his sagging cheeks he battled for one<lb facs="P22_TL00023"/>word of hope with the remaining physician.<lb facs="P22_TL00024"/>"I tell you it's impossible!" he shouted, leaning over the massive<lb facs="P22_TL00025"/>mahogany desk with two stubby hands pressed upon the gleaming surface,<lb facs="P22_TL00026"/>the fumes from his distorted mouth puffing into the delicate face of the<lb facs="P22_TL00027"/>physician who was seated in the desk chair "Every bottle in my vault was<lb facs="P22_TL00028"/>sealed in bond. It was bought and stored away before boot-legging was<lb facs="P22_TL00029"/>an infant industry.

The latter took the suspicious-looking article, his eyes<lb facs="P23_TL00018"/>fixed challengingly on the impassive witness, and then with a puzzled glance<lb facs="P23_TL00019"/>at the flask he sniffed of the contents.<lb facs="P23_TL00020"/>"Where the Hell did you get this?" he exploded. And before the<lb facs="P23_TL00021"/>answer came, he continued: "It's poison! Good God, I'd feed such stuff<lb facs="P23_TL00022"/>to the rats that steal my cheese! You don't tell me that my son —"<lb facs="P23_TL00023"/>"Your son, Mr. Gonover," Keene interrupted, courteously offering his<lb facs="P23_TL00024"/>hand for the return of the exhibit, "belongs to another generation whose<lb facs="P23_TL00025"/>brain-cells do not react to the suave virtues that please your old-fashioned<lb facs="P23_TL00026"/>taste.

The stuff in this flask, vile as it is, comes high."<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>A change had come over Price Conover while the doctor was talking,<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>and in an absent way turning the flask in his hands, a change that the<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>matter-of-fact physician was aware of only when he looked up at the<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>conclusion of his remarks. Conover was standing very erect and in his<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>little red-rimmed eyes was flame.

The crash of it resounded<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>in the doctor's sensitive imagination. Conover snatched a flat square book<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>out of the litter of papers, opened it violently, and scrawled upon one of<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>its pages. A jagged strip of paper flapped in his stubby hand. Keene took<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>the check and bowed.<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>Relating the incident afterward at dinner in his club, he confessed<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>that as he walked by the squat bulk of Conover he, the eminent scientist,<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>felt a strange uneasiness and a contempt for the part he had played.<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>"How could I have imagined in that man, apparently all fleshy appetite,<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>so vast a paternal feeling?

She came forward and<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>leaned her tall abundant figure over the desk. What she saw was a mass<lb facs="P25_TL00027"/>of sagging flesh without human expression except for the glint of some<lb facs="P25_TL00028"/>mad red fire in the little bloodshot eyes.

The guests exhibited the foolish dismay of an<lb facs="P26_TL00029"/>audience which has unexpectedly been dragged into participation in a drama<lb facs="P26_TL00030"/>within a drama.<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>Hillyard who had taken a position between Conover and the outside<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>door voiced the general deprecation of the charge launched against them.<lb facs="P26_TL00033"/>Conover's answer was to wrap himself in his fur-lined coat, crowd a soft<lb facs="P26_TL00034"/>hat down over his eyes, and then to face his friend with a determination<lb facs="P26_TL00035"/>ominous of instant action.

The open door of the air-tight stove exhaled a blissful<lb facs="P27_TL00020"/>stream of heated air and the good doctor puffed gratefully from his tired<lb facs="P27_TL00021"/>lungs. The bustling feet and hands of his wife in the next room were<lb facs="P27_TL00022"/>producing sounds that heralded the hearty supper that his being comfortably<lb facs="P27_TL00023"/>craved, the experience of twenty three years assuring him that it would be<lb facs="P27_TL00024"/>promptly served.<lb facs="P27_TL00025"/>f'Don't you want the lamp lit, Sam?

It looked like<lb facs="P28_TL00008"/>Mr. Conover. His shape ain't the kind you can mistake even in this light.<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>You don't suppose he was thinking of asking you to look at his son, do you?"<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>"I hope not. I'm not bidding for Conover's trade. Not that I wouldn't<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>go if he asked me. But he won't. He had three or four big specialists down<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>from New York today and pitched them all out, I hear. He's a rough one."<lb facs="P28_TL00013"/>His wife sniffed. "I should say he was. Still I think he might have<lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>asked you. Of course I shouldn't want you to go. It would be against the<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>Lord's will to help save that boy from the consequences of his sin.

Talbot ejaculated out of a thick doze. "Oh, yes, the wobblies.<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>Yes, I thought it was kind of tough, they weren't doing any particular harm."<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>"Harm!"

Sam laughed gently. "But the fellow made a good answer. He told<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>Ben that was the right spirit, to give the thing he needed most. It's funny,<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>though.

To this evidence of the nearness of what he sought was<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>presently added the companionable click of a typewriter. His imagination<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>thus assisted he imaged the dark outline of a barn faintly projected on the<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>sky.

A lantern with a yellowed glass chimney hung on a nail over their<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>heads and tinged with a fiction of warmth their hollowed cheeks.

Something in the massive stolidity of the man conveyed authority,<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>and the man called "Red" rose to his slender height and curved his arm<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>defensively about the carriage of the typewriter.

For<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>a moment there was tense silence; on one side it was the panting desperation<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>of the hunted, on the other the unspoken appeal of a statue in which was<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>kindled the spark of a desire to become human.

As the light from the lantern wavered<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>off toward the barn and the dead weight of the night shut down upon him<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>Gonover had need to muster all his courage to keep from crying out his fear.<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>A door of steel had silently been shut and locked between him and the<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>freedom of the cold earth, and about him stretched the infinite territory of<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>the unknown, and, to his mind, the ever unknowable.

This did not seem at all remarkable but natural.<lb facs="P35_TL00003"/>It was natural too that the wall of darkness expanded tremendously and<lb facs="P35_TL00004"/>broke and that it was a morning in spring, a curved blue morning, and<lb facs="P35_TL00005"/>that the earth was a sphere within a sphere of light. The earth was his<lb facs="P35_TL00006"/>son and he was the light running up and down the years of his son's life<lb facs="P35_TL00007"/>like a child playing on a flight of stairs. Then the light fled with a sigh<lb facs="P35_TL00008"/>and hid in the dark corner of a room and spoke to him.<lb facs="P35_TL00009"/>The sound of the voice split Price Gonover evenly into two parts. One<lb facs="P35_TL00010"/>part stood upright but ashamed and trembling; the other part crouched<lb facs="P35_TL00011"/>and braced itself to fight. The latter was himself, that he knew; the other<lb facs="P35_TL00012"/>he did not know. Over in the dark corner lay Price, his son. The upright<lb facs="P35_TL00013"/>self tried to cross the step or two between them but the crouching one<lb facs="P35_TL00014"/>dragged at the ankles of the other and held him back. There was some<lb facs="P35_TL00015"/>one with Price who soothed him with measured words.<lb facs="P35_TL00016"/>The words also had a strength that steadied the upright self of the<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>father until like a childlike thing he dared to take a step. As he went<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>forward that crouching thing behind him gave up the struggle and, as though<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>discouraged, slipped out of the cramped space, down to the frozen ground,<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>and off into the night. Again he felt the crust break beneath his feet. He<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>slid and stumbled in a rut. The branches of the trees grew sharp and black<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>against the paling sky.<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>But the upright self of the man, now straight and tall, stood looking<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>down upon the face of his son and upon the composed features of the youth<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>played the light that had fled into the corner with a sigh. The light shone<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>from the eyes of a man who said: "Except ye see signs and wonders, ye<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>will not believe."<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>Then these eyes were turned up to the shamed face of the father<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>and the worn face of the man they called "The Master" became young<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>with tenderness.<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>ffGo thy way, thy son liveth." And it was with these words in his<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>ears that the door of his house was opened, and Hillyard said: ffl thought<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>that you were not alone, Price, and I know that you walked with your<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>head up."</ab>

A rhythmic silence, rising from its quietness,<lb facs="P42_TL00008"/>softly accents its mood of peace.

Like a pavement flooring<lb facs="P42_TL00011"/>a streak of sky, it stretches through Whitcomb between two rows of homes<lb facs="P42_TL00012"/>and shops: incurious, passive, glaringly white, it lies relaxed and silent.<lb facs="P42_TL00013"/>Four stores, out of the four blocks of shops which line it, are open on<lb facs="P42_TL00014"/>Sunday; these are the three Drug Stores, and the fourth is Frank's Smoke<lb facs="P42_TL00015"/>House.<lb facs="P42_TL00016"/>Inside Frank's Smoke House, up in the front around the soft drinks<lb facs="P42_TL00017"/>fountain, some men are standing in a ragged spread of tobacco smoke.

Spain cannot be blamed for the crassness of the<lb facs="P46_TL00009"/>discoverers. They moved out across the seas stirred by instincts, ancient<lb facs="P46_TL00010"/>beyond thought as the depths they were crossing, which they obeyed under<lb facs="P46_TL00011"/>the names of King or Christ or whatever it might be, while they watched<lb facs="P46_TL00012"/>the recreative New unfolding itself miraculously before them, before them,<lb facs="P46_TL00013"/>deafened and blinded. Steering beyond familiar horizons they were driven to<lb facs="P46_TL00014"/>seek perhaps self-justification for victorious wars against Arab and Moor; but<lb facs="P46_TL00015"/>these things are the surface only. At the back, as it remains, it was the<lb facs="P46_TL00016"/>evil of the whole world; it was the perennial disappointment which follows,<lb facs="P46_TL00017"/>like smoke, the bursting of ideas. It was the spirit of malice which underlies<lb facs="P46_TL00018"/>men's lives and against which nothing offers resistance. And bitter as the<lb facs="P46_TL00019"/>thought may be that Tenochtitlan, the barbaric city, its people, its genius<lb facs="P46_TL00020"/>wherever found should have been crushed out because of the awkward<lb facs="P46_TL00021"/>names men give their emptiness, yet it was no man's fault.

Courageous almost<lb facs="P46_TL00024"/>beyond precedent, tactful, resourceful in misfortune, he was a man of genius<lb facs="P46_TL00025"/>superbly suited to his task.

Surmounting every difficulty Cortez went his way into the<lb facs="P48_TL00007"/>country past the quiet cempoalan maizefields, past the smoking summit<lb facs="P48_TL00008"/>of Popocatepetl until, after weeks of labor, he arrived upon the great lakes<lb facs="P48_TL00009"/>and the small cities in them adjoining Tenochtitlan itself. Montezuma<lb facs="P48_TL00010"/>seeing that there was nothing else for it, sent envoys accompanied by three<lb facs="P48_TL00011"/>hundred warriors, who met the Spaniard advancing on the lake road and<lb facs="P48_TL00012"/>there welcomed him to the district with great ceremony and show of<lb facs="P48_TL00013"/>friendliness. Noticeable among them was one young man of magnificent<lb facs="P48_TL00014"/>appearance who descended from his litter and walked to meet the Conqueror<lb facs="P48_TL00015"/>while his followers ran before him, picking up stones and other small<lb facs="P48_TL00016"/>obstructions which lay in his path. Cortez now passed over his first<lb facs="P48_TL00017"/>causeway into one of the lesser lake cities, built of well-hewn stone sheer<lb facs="P48_TL00018"/>from the water. He was overcome with wonder. The houses were so<lb facs="P48_TL00019"/>excellently put together, so well decorated with cloths and carven wood,<lb facs="P48_TL00020"/>so embellished with metalwork and other marks of a beautiful civilisation;<lb facs="P48_TL00021"/>the people were so gracious; there were such gardens, such trees, such<lb facs="P48_TL00022"/>conservatories of flowers that nothing like it had ever been seen or imagined.<lb facs="P48_TL00023"/>At the house where the Conqueror was entertained that day and night he<lb facs="P48_TL00024"/>especially noted a pool built of stone into the clear waters of which stone<lb facs="P48_TL00025"/>steps descended while round it were paven paths lined with sweet-smelling<lb facs="P48_TL00026"/>shrubs and plants and trees of all sorts. Also he noted the well stocked<lb facs="P48_TL00027"/>kitchen garden. The following day at noon he arrived at the end of<lb facs="P48_TL00028"/>his journey.<lb facs="P48_TL00029"/>There it lay! a city as large as Cordova or Seville, entirely within the<lb facs="P48_TL00030"/>lake two miles from the mainland: Tenochtitlan. Four avenues or entrances<lb facs="P48_TL00031"/>led to it all formed of artificial causeways. Along the most easterly of these,<lb facs="P48_TL00032"/>constructed of great beams perfectly hewn and fitted together, and measuring<lb facs="P48_TL00033"/>two spears-lengths in width, the Christian advanced. Running in at one<lb facs="P48_TL00034"/>side of the city and out at the other this avenue constituted at the same<lb facs="P48_TL00035"/>time its principal street. As Cortez drew nearer he saw, right and left,<lb facs="P48_TL00036"/>magnificent houses and temples, close to the walls of which, each side,<lb facs="P48_TL00037"/>moved parallel rows of priests in black robes and between them, supported<lb facs="P48_TL00038"/>by two attendants, Montezuma, on foot, down the center of the roadway.<lb facs="P48_TL00039"/>Cortez stepped forward but the attendants interceded. The Emperor then<lb facs="P48_TL00040"/>advanced alone and with great simpleness of manner placed a golden chain<lb facs="P48_TL00041"/>about the Christian's neck.

Everything had been prepared in advance: all the<lb facs="P49_TL00005"/>material needs together with rich gifts, as before: precious metals, gems,<lb facs="P49_TL00006"/>male and female apparel of remarkable elegance, ornamental hangings for<lb facs="P49_TL00007"/>bed-chambers, tapestries for halls and temples, counterpanes composed of<lb facs="P49_TL00008"/>feathers interwoven with cotton and many beautiful and curious artifices<lb facs="P49_TL00009"/>ffof so costly and unusual workmanship that considering their novelty<lb facs="P49_TL00010"/>and wonderful beauty no price could be set on them." Here in this large<lb facs="P49_TL00011"/>building whose great hall was to serve the Spaniards for barracks from<lb facs="P49_TL00012"/>that time until the end, Montezuma and Gortez found themselves seated<lb facs="P49_TL00013"/>at last face to face. Montezuma spoke: They have told you that I possess<lb facs="P49_TL00014"/>houses with walls of gold and many other such things and that I am<lb facs="P49_TL00015"/>a god or make myself one. The houses you see are of stone and lime and<lb facs="P49_TL00016"/>earth. — Then opening his robe: You see that I am composed of flesh<lb facs="P49_TL00017"/>and bone like yourselves and that I am mortal and palpable to the touch. —<lb facs="P49_TL00018"/>To this smiling sally, so full of gentleness and amused irony, Cortez could<lb facs="P49_TL00019"/>reply nothing save to demand that the man declare himself a subject of the<lb facs="P49_TL00020"/>Spanish King forthwith and that, furthermore, he should then and there<lb facs="P49_TL00021"/>announce publicly his allegiance to the new power. — Whatever the Aztec<lb facs="P49_TL00022"/>might have felt during the weeks of Cortez' slow advance upon his capital<lb facs="P49_TL00023"/>from the seashore, nothing at the present moment seemed to disturb his<lb facs="P49_TL00024"/>aristocratic reserve. He had thought and he had made up his mind.<lb facs="P49_TL00025"/>Without semblance of anger, fear or impatience; without humility or protest<lb facs="P49_TL00026"/>but with the force bred of a determination to face at any cost a situation<lb facs="P49_TL00027"/>fast going beyond his control, he spoke again. He explained that his people<lb facs="P49_TL00028"/>were not the aborigines of the land but that they had emigrated there in<lb facs="P49_TL00029"/>times past and ended by accepting the Spanish Monarch as his rightful<lb facs="P49_TL00030"/>and hereditary master. After due announcements and explanations had<lb facs="P49_TL00031"/>been made to the people Gortez became the acknowledged regent, in the<lb facs="P49_TL00032"/>name of Castille and the true church, for all that country.<lb facs="P49_TL00033"/>Streets, public squares, markets, temples, palaces, the city spread its<lb facs="P49_TL00034"/>dark life upon the earth of a new world, rooted there, sensitive to its<lb facs="P49_TL00035"/>richest beauty, but so completely removed from those foreign contacts<lb facs="P49_TL00036"/>which harden and protect, that at the very breath of conquest it vanished.<lb facs="P49_TL00037"/>The whole world of its unique associations sank back into the ground to<lb facs="P49_TL00038"/>be reenkindled, never. Never, at least, save in spirit; a spirit mysterious,<lb facs="P49_TL00039"/>constructive, independant, puissant with natural wealth, light if it may be<lb facs="P49_TL00040"/>as feathers, a spirit lost in that soil.

Here f'everything which the world<lb facs="P50_TL00012"/>affords" was offered for purchase, from the personal services of laborers<lb facs="P50_TL00013"/>and porters to the last refinements of bijouterie; gold, silver, lead, brass,<lb facs="P50_TL00014"/>copper, tin; wrought and unwrought stone, bricks burnt and unburnt,<lb facs="P50_TL00015"/>timber hewn and unhewn, of different sorts; game of every variety, fowls,<lb facs="P50_TL00016"/>quails, partridges, wild ducks, parrots, pigeons, reed-birds, sparrows, eagles,<lb facs="P50_TL00017"/>hawks, owls, likewise the skins of some birds of prey with their feathers,<lb facs="P50_TL00018"/>head, beak and claws; rabbits, hares, deer and little dogs, wThich they<lb facs="P50_TL00019"/>raised for eating; wood and coals in abundance and brasiers of earthenware<lb facs="P50_TL00020"/>for burning coals; mats of various kinds; all kinds of green vegetables,<lb facs="P50_TL00021"/>especially onions, leeks, watercresses, nasturtium, sorrel, artichokes and<lb facs="P50_TL00022"/>golden thistle; fruits, fish, honey, grain—either whole, in the form of flour<lb facs="P50_TL00023"/>or baked into loaves; different kinds of cotton thread of all colors; jars,<lb facs="P50_TL00024"/>jugs, pots and an endless variety of vessels, all made of fine clay, most<lb facs="P50_TL00025"/>of them glazed and painted; eggs, cakes, pates of birds and fish; wine<lb facs="P50_TL00026"/>from the maguey; finally everything that could be found throughout the<lb facs="P50_TL00027"/>whole country was sold there, each kind of merchandise in a separate street<lb facs="P50_TL00028"/>or quarter of the market assigned to it exclusively and thus the best order<lb facs="P50_TL00029"/>was preserved. There was an herb street, there were shops where they<lb facs="P50_TL00030"/>shaved and washed the head, and restaurateurs who furnished food and<lb facs="P50_TL00031"/>drink at a price.<lb facs="P50_TL00032"/>Large numbers of temples existed throughout the great city but for<lb facs="P50_TL00033"/>grandeur and excellence of architectural detail one far surpassed the rest.<lb facs="P50_TL00034"/>Forty towers, lofty and well built, rose from within its sacred precinct,<lb facs="P50_TL00035"/>the largest of which, constructed of hewn stone remarkably hard in texture,<lb facs="P50_TL00036"/>had fifty steps leading to its main body. A mass higher than the cathedral<lb facs="P50_TL00037"/>of Seville. Three halls of wonderful extent and height, adorned with figures<lb facs="P50_TL00038"/>sculptured in wood and stone, contained the principal idols. And from<lb facs="P50_TL00039"/>these, through very small doors, opened the chapels, to which no light was<lb facs="P50_TL00040"/>admitted, nor any person except the priests, and not all of them.

                                    <lb facs="P51_TL00003"/>stained, it was in these chapels that the religious practices which so shocked<lb facs="P51_TL00004"/>the Christian were performed. Here it was that the tribe's deep feeling for<lb facs="P51_TL00005"/>a reality that stems back into the permanence of remote origins had its<lb facs="P51_TL00006"/>firmhold. It was the earthward thrust of their logic; blood and earth; the<lb facs="P51_TL00007"/>realization of their primal and continuous identity with the ground itself,<lb facs="P51_TL00008"/>where everything is fixed in darkness. The priests in black robes, tribal<lb facs="P51_TL00009"/>men, never cutting or combing the hair; the instinctive exclusion of<lb facs="P51_TL00010"/>women from all places of worship; the debarring of priests from<lb facs="P51_TL00011"/>female society: it was a ceremonial acknowledgment of the deep sexless<lb facs="P51_TL00012"/>urge of life itself, the hungry animal, underlying all other power; the<lb facs="P51_TL00013"/>mysterious secret of existence whose cruel beauty they, the living, inherited<lb facs="P51_TL00014"/>from the dead. The same for their sculpture. It is the mystery of the<lb facs="P51_TL00015"/>past which monsters, grotesques, beasts combined with the human, truly<lb facs="P51_TL00016"/>signify; gentle animal associations distorted by the invasions of night; and<lb facs="P51_TL00017"/>not a debased instinct whose reliance is necessarily upon oppression and<lb facs="P51_TL00018"/>fear. The earth is black and it is there: only art advances. The figures of<lb facs="P51_TL00019"/>the idols themselves were of extra-human size and composed, significantly,<lb facs="P51_TL00020"/>of a paste of seeds and leguminous plants, commonly used for food, ground<lb facs="P51_TL00021"/>and mixed together and kneaded with human blood, the whole when<lb facs="P51_TL00022"/>completed being consecrated with a bath of blood from the heart of a living<lb facs="P51_TL00023"/>victim. The chief of these idols Gortez precipitated from their pedestals<lb facs="P51_TL00024"/>and cast down the temple steps; an act of extraordinary daring; at the<lb facs="P51_TL00025"/>same time purifying the chapels and setting up in them images of Our Lady<lb facs="P51_TL00026"/>and the saints. Such a stroke could not fail to have proved of the most<lb facs="P51_TL00027"/>serious consequence to all had not Montezuma again displayed his tact,<lb facs="P51_TL00028"/>self control and remarkable grasp of the changing situation. The new<lb facs="P51_TL00029"/>state of affairs was accepted, human sacrifice was abolished and the orderly<lb facs="P51_TL00030"/>significance of the events taking place was publicly made evident. In<lb facs="P51_TL00031"/>person, together with many of the principal citizens, he, Montezuma,<lb facs="P51_TL00032"/>assisted at the final purification of the chapels. Whether or not this be<lb facs="P51_TL00033"/>evidence on the Aztec's part of weakness or the deepest forbearance, surely<lb facs="P51_TL00034"/>nothing like it for quiet flexibility of temper and retained dignity has ever<lb facs="P51_TL00035"/>been recorded. Perhaps by a sudden, daring stroke this man might have<lb facs="P51_TL00036"/>rid himself of the intestine enemy who was each day, each week striking<lb facs="P51_TL00037"/>deeper at the nation's life. Perhaps fear had unmanned him. Perhaps<lb facs="P51_TL00038"/>what we call forbearance was no more than the timidity which is an<lb facs="P51_TL00039"/>overwhelming agony of heart inspired by the sight of a resistless force<lb facs="P51_TL00040"/>aimed at our destruction. Still, if this be so, Montezuma has left no trace<lb facs="P51_TL00041"/>of cowardice upon the records. But weakling or genius, about the suave</ab>

The whole waking aspirations of his people, opposed<lb facs="P52_TL00008"/>to and completing their religious sense, seemed to come off in him and<lb facs="P52_TL00009"/>in him alone: the drive upward, toward the sun and the stars. He was<lb facs="P52_TL00010"/>the very person of their ornate dreams, so delicate, so prismatically colorful,<lb facs="P52_TL00011"/>so full of tinkling sounds and rhythms, so tireless of invention. Never was<lb facs="P52_TL00012"/>such a surface lifted above the isolate blackness of such profound savagery.<lb facs="P52_TL00013"/>It is delightful to know that Montezuma changed his clothes four times<lb facs="P52_TL00014"/>a day, donning four different suits, entirely new, which he never wore<lb facs="P52_TL00015"/>again; that at meals he was served in a great cleans wept chamber on mats<lb facs="P52_TL00016"/>upon the floor, his food being kept warm in chafing dishes containing live<lb facs="P52_TL00017"/>coals; that at meals he sat upon a small cushion "curiously wrought of<lb facs="P52_TL00018"/>leather." But nowhere in his state was the stark power of beauty, the<lb facs="P52_TL00019"/>refined and the barbaric, so exquisitely expressed as in his smaller palaces<lb facs="P52_TL00020"/>and places of amusement. "What can be more wonderful than that a<lb facs="P52_TL00021"/>barbarous monarch, as he is, should have every object in his domain imitated<lb facs="P52_TL00022"/>in gold, silver, precious stones and feathers; the gold and silver being<lb facs="P52_TL00023"/>wrought so naturally as not to be surpassed by any smith in the world;<lb facs="P52_TL00024"/>the stone work executed with such perfection that it is difficult to conceive<lb facs="P52_TL00025"/>what instruments could have been used, and the feather work superior to<lb facs="P52_TL00026"/>the finest productions in wax and embroidery." "There is one palace,<lb facs="P52_TL00027"/>inferior to the rest, attached to which is a beautiful garden with balconies<lb facs="P52_TL00028"/>extending over it supported by marble columns and having a floor formed<lb facs="P52_TL00029"/>of jasper elegantly inlaid. Belonging to it are ten pools, in which are kept<lb facs="P52_TL00030"/>the different species of water birds found in the country, all domesticated:<lb facs="P52_TL00031"/>for the sea birds there are pools of salt water and for the river birds, fresh<lb facs="P52_TL00032"/>water. Each species being supplied with the food natural to it when wild.<lb facs="P52_TL00033"/>Over the pools are corridors and galleries, to which Montezuma resorts,<lb facs="P52_TL00034"/>and from which he can look out and amuse himself with the sight of the<lb facs="P52_TL00035"/>birds there." "In an apartment of the same palace there are men, women<lb facs="P52_TL00036"/>and children whose faces, bodies, hair, eyebrows and eyelashes were white<lb facs="P52_TL00037"/>from birth." "The Emperor has another very beautiful palace, with a large<lb facs="P52_TL00038"/>courtyard, paved with handsome flags in the style of a chessboard. There<lb facs="P52_TL00039"/>are cages about nine feet in height and six paces square, each of which<lb facs="P52_TL00040"/>is half covered with a roof of tiles, and the other half has over it a wooden<lb facs="P52_TL00041"/>grate, skillfully made.

                                    <lb facs="P53_TL00002"/>"In the same palace there are several large halls on the ground floor, filled<lb facs="P53_TL00003"/>with immense cages built of heavy pieces of timber, well put together, in<lb facs="P53_TL00004"/>which are kept lions, wolves, foxes and a great variety of other animals<lb facs="P53_TL00005"/>of the cat kind." "The care of these animals and birds is assigned to three<lb facs="P53_TL00006"/>hundred men." Daily the Emperor's wine cellar and larder were open<lb facs="P53_TL00007"/>to all who wished to eat and drink. His meals were served by three or four<lb facs="P53_TL00008"/>hundred youths who brought on an infinite variety of dishes; indeed<lb facs="P53_TL00009"/>whenever he dined or supped, the table was loaded with every kind of fish,<lb facs="P53_TL00010"/>flesh, fruits and vegetables which the country afforded. Both at the<lb facs="P53_TL00011"/>beginning and end of every meal they furnished water for the hands, and<lb facs="P53_TL00012"/>the napkins used on these occasions were never employed a second time.<lb facs="P53_TL00013"/>And then the end: Gortez had demanded gold from the first. To<lb facs="P53_TL00014"/>satisfy him, small groups of two Spaniards and two Indians, bearing the<lb facs="P53_TL00015"/>proper credentials, had been despatched about the Aztec's domain, to<lb facs="P53_TL00016"/>distances in some cases of several hundred miles, that the tribute be<lb facs="P53_TL00017"/>collected. On one of these forays the two Christians were killed. Gortez<lb facs="P53_TL00018"/>immediately seized the person of Montezuma, together with his daughters<lb facs="P53_TL00019"/>and sons, imprisoning them in the garrison-fortress. From that time on<lb facs="P53_TL00020"/>it was merely a matter of detail and of time as to what form the final<lb facs="P53_TL00021"/>catastrophe would take. Events shifted back and forth until in May, seven<lb facs="P53_TL00022"/>months after the Spaniards' first entrance to the city, the people laid siege<lb facs="P53_TL00023"/>to the intolerable intruders, determined to have done with them. In answer<lb facs="P53_TL00024"/>to shouts from outside, Montezuma, a prisoner within, had appeared on<lb facs="P53_TL00025"/>the ramparts of the besieged fortress whence he implored his people to give<lb facs="P53_TL00026"/>over their attacks. In reply he was struck on the head by a stone which<lb facs="P53_TL00027"/>killed him. Only the horse and the ordnance saved the Christians on that<lb facs="P53_TL00028"/>memorable retreat across the great causeway. Fighting madly to escape<lb facs="P53_TL00029"/>with some remnant of his forces through the masses of the enemy, and to<lb facs="P53_TL00030"/>retain at the same time his prisoners and treasure, Cortez lost everything.<lb facs="P53_TL00031"/>The children of Montezuma, the gold, everything perished over the<lb facs="P53_TL00032"/>sides of the breached and beleaguered avenue across the lake down which<lb facs="P53_TL00033"/>ihe Spaniards retreated, foot by foot, with swarms of Indians flinging<lb facs="P53_TL00034"/>themselves continually upon them. They escaped. Some months later they<lb facs="P53_TL00035"/>returned and continued the destruction, this time deliberately and with<lb facs="P53_TL00036"/>calculated malintention. Tenochtitlan surrounded, the water supply cut off,<lb facs="P53_TL00037"/>the augmented Spanish forces began to burrow forward and after weeks<lb facs="P53_TL00038"/>of desperate effort they succeeded in their plans. It was the horses the Indians<lb facs="P53_TL00039"/>feared most. At one time they had Cortez in their very hands only to have<lb facs="P53_TL00040"/>them cut off at the wrists by his followers. But nothing could bemuse<lb facs="P53_TL00041"/>them now. They knew now what it all meant and they opposed themselves</ab>

To every advance made inviting them<lb facs="P54_TL00006"/>to parley they had but the one answer: no! Gortez, dejected, seeing that<lb facs="P54_TL00007"/>it would be necessary to exterminate them before he could succeed in taking<lb facs="P54_TL00008"/>the city and dreading the horror of such a course, decided with reluctance,<lb facs="P54_TL00009"/>in order to impress them, to burn the noble edifices in the great square which<lb facs="P54_TL00010"/>had served Montezuma for aviarys. "It grieved me much but it grieved<lb facs="P54_TL00011"/>the enemy more." Each day he heard mass and returned to the city to<lb facs="P54_TL00012"/>renew the attack upon the now nearly starved inhabitants who had retreated<lb facs="P54_TL00013"/>to the market quarter and there still held out.

Most had already<lb facs="P54_TL00017"/>joined the Christian in his irresistible purpose. But Guatemotzin, the young<lb facs="P54_TL00018"/>nephew of Montezuma, would not give in.

Mr. Glenway Wescott praises<lb facs="P71_TL00009"/>the sternness of H. D.'s translations. "No race of men ever subsisted on<lb facs="P71_TL00010"/>sweet rhetorical distinction," he says and in her work, it is life denuded<lb facs="P71_TL00011"/>of subterfuge—it is the clean violence of truth that we have. Only as one<lb facs="P71_TL00012"/>isolates portions of the work, does one perceive the magic and compressed<lb facs="P71_TL00013"/>energy of the author's imagination, actuality in such lines as the following,<lb facs="P71_TL00014"/>being lost in the sense of spectacle:<lb facs="P71_TL00015"/>"dark islands in a sea<lb facs="P71_TL00016"/>of grey olive or wild white olive<lb facs="P71_TL00017"/>cut with the sudden cypress shafts;"<lb facs="P71_TL00018"/>fingers "wrought of iron<lb facs="P71_TL00019"/>to wrest from earth<lb facs="P71_TL00020"/>secrets; strong to protect,<lb facs="P71_TL00021"/>strong to keep back the winter."<lb facs="P71_TL00022"/>One recognizes here, the artist—the mind which creates what it needs<lb facs="P71_TL00023"/>for its own subsistence and propitiates nothing, willing—indeed wishing to<lb facs="P71_TL00024"/>seem to find its only counterpart in the elements; yet in this case as in the<lb facs="P71_TL00025"/>case of any true artist, reserve is a concomitant of intense feeling, not the<lb facs="P71_TL00026"/>cause of it. In H. D.'s work, there is not so much reserve as insistence<lb facs="P71_TL00027"/>upon certain qualities; nature in its acute aspects is to her, a symbol of<lb facs="P71_TL00028"/>freedom. A liking for surf for instance, makes the contemplation of still<lb facs="P71_TL00029"/>water seem like loathing as in Swinburne when one recalls his comparison</ab>

This, too, is an age of declaimers; our great rhetoricians intone<lb facs="P77_TL00007"/>their manifold prophecies from balloon, fence, screen, or incandescent sign,<lb facs="P77_TL00008"/>with an informed ardour. The oracle of Marianne Moore, however, is not<lb facs="P77_TL00009"/>subsidized, and adopts more varied tones again; her discontentments, her<lb facs="P77_TL00010"/>fainter heresies and criticisms lead to no great matter; yet, to us they are<lb facs="P77_TL00011"/>as poignant as the futile sword-brandishing of a Tamerlane.

For a poet who deliberately adopted a minor tone, Mr. Eliot<lb facs="P77_TL00030"/>has had a subtle and farspread influence. Let it be said that this later<lb facs="P77_TL00031"/>group of poems justifies the almost reluctant repect for him on the part<lb facs="P77_TL00032"/>of the younger American and English writers. For, he does move forward,<lb facs="P77_TL00033"/>though modestly, from the mood of Prufrock to new terrain, in The Waste<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

From the very first line, "April<lb facs="P78_TL00017"/>is the cruelest month," to the ultimate evasion of the concluding lines<lb facs="P78_TL00018"/>of the last poem we have the troubled strain of Prufrock again.

But I fear that<lb facs="P78_TL00029"/>it is precisely in his most facile moments that he has appealed most and<lb facs="P78_TL00030"/>been most echoed. His real distinction, his indubitable mastery of a style,<lb facs="P78_TL00031"/>have been more difficult to assail, however removed he may be from the<lb facs="P78_TL00032"/>less grateful climate of modern America.</ab>

And<lb facs="P83_TL00009"/>BROOM has set itself the task of bringing the new work of living artists in America<lb facs="P83_TL00010"/>and Europe to the intelligent reading public of America. (Nor has BROOM ever<lb facs="P83_TL00011"/>underestimated the taste of that public.) Thus each number of BROOM is a<lb facs="P83_TL00012"/>departure, a fresh adventure winning new plunder for its readers.<lb facs="P83_TL00013"/>In the FEBRUARY issue there will be published:<lb facs="P83_TL00014"/>A short nove\,'transformations, by Richard Huelsenbeck,a work whose extraordi-<lb facs="P83_TL00015"/>nary fantasy and humor recall the qualities of German folk-tales of the Middle Ages.<lb facs="P83_TL00016"/>Drawings by the too little known masters, Paul Klee and George Gross, which,<lb facs="P83_TL00017"/>suggesting much the same qualities, have an intensely modern consciousness.<lb facs="P83_TL00018"/>Two drawings by inmates of a lunatic asylum which possess plastic and<lb facs="P83_TL00019"/>imaginative value far in advance of their more normal contemporaries.<lb facs="P83_TL00020"/>The Kid, a story by Vsevolod Ivanov, a new Russian writer, who draws<lb facs="P83_TL00021"/>an amazing picture of present-day Russia, with primitive power and simplicity.<lb facs="P83_TL00022"/>Red Eric, by William Carlos Williams, the second of a series of histo-<lb facs="P83_TL00023"/>rical studies — history as it was certainly never written nor sung!<lb facs="P83_TL00024"/>And distinctive American prose and poetry by Carleton Beals, Malcolm<lb facs="P83_TL00025"/>Cowley, John Crawford, Evelyn Scott, William Gamaliel Shepherd, Paul<lb facs="P83_TL00026"/>Eldridge, and others.<lb facs="P83_TL00027"/>Therefore the heavy demand for backnumbers of BROOM, which entirely exhausted<lb facs="P83_TL00028"/>several issues last year, has been not at all surprising.
