                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00003"/>The water was cold and freshening as it poured from the brass<lb facs="P5_TL00004"/>tap over his fingers and wrists, and he was so occupied with his<lb facs="P5_TL00005"/>pleasure that he scarcely noticed his wife passing through the<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>scullery and only heard her voice vaguely, saying, "I'm going out to<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>see about a black wren." He shook the water from his fingers, dried<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>them, and stepped back to his chair repeating her phrase abstractedly,<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>"I'm going out to see about a black wren. ... A black wren.<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>What did she mean—had she found a black wren, or why did<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>she want to see about it? Its small bright eye—no, she didn't mean<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>that, but a small black bird, black as a rook, sheeny and black, but<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>not languid and heavy as a rook. What did she want with a black<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>wren? The phrase reminded him of another small bird, the brisk<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>and friendly robin, that perched on his spade if he rested—long rests<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>between each thrust and lift—pecked, fluttered, perched nearer, and<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>looked up so kin-like and bright. It wasn't that the birds of the garden<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>and hedge had any special fondness for him; wild things didn't notice<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>or trouble about him. . . . Stay, there was that squirrel, actually<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>a slightly lame squirrel that wasn't nearly as agile as it should have<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>been. He had stumbled almost upon it and it had leaped away<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>(leaping a little awry, he thought) and then looked as if it trusted<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>him not to harm—not to harm it with a cruel thought even. How<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>pretty it looked—no, pathetic more than pretty. He had wanted to<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>stroke the squirrel, to pat it, but suddenly thought that a motion of<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>kindness might seem but as a motion of cruelty, and startle the sly<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>small thing. So he hung still and it disappeared.<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>A black wren, a squirrel: even the gentlest things seemed sad<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>amid their gaiety. The loveliness of limb and motion, of flight and<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>leap, was at the mercy of his hand. Where did the wren come from,<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>where would it hide to die? All these deaths of lovely living things—<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>sorrow in all loveliness. Botticelli's Venus, where was that now?<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>In Maggie's room still, no doubt. She had asked him for it when she<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>was fourteen or fifteen. "I must look at it when Igo upstairs. Is it as<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>beautiful as I used to think it, or is it too sad to be lovely now? What<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>a beautiful thing once, yet melancholy. There's too much green in it—<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>it's melancholy as the woods in spring. But melancholy means black—<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>a black wren. . . . Strange!" Green, too, was always melancholy</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00002"/>—the April green, the pallid fresh green of buds and small leaves<lb facs="P6_TL00003"/>showing paler yet against the russet husks. The Venus rose from the<lb facs="P6_TL00004"/>sea like the pale spring rising from dark winter—a pretty fancy, yet<lb facs="P6_TL00005"/>true. It was the old sadness of that poor goddess that made him feel—<lb facs="P6_TL00006"/>how? Well, he felt as if he were looking not at Venus but at a<lb facs="P6_TL00007"/>crucifix. He couldn't help it, they were counterparts, twin types blend<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00008"/>ing into one. Venus here, Jesus there, both sad in beauty, one lonely<lb facs="P6_TL00009"/>the other martyred. He wasn't confusing the two and of course one<lb facs="P6_TL00010"/>was pagan and the other christian; "but they're really the same, the<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>same. The body's crucified in Jesus, and it escapes in Venus, but only<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>for a time. Venus is thinking of the crucifixion—as sad as Jesus him<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>self. She too will be crucified—everything lovely, everything eternal is<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>crucified; else it can't be eternal." That was why, if he thought of the<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>one, so often he thought of the other; they didn't live apart, and one,<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>he supposed, couldn't live without the other.<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>The loveliness! though he was old-fashioned, he knew, in his<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>adoration. But one couldn't do without beauty, one couldn't glo with<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>out faith; an altar was necessary, and even if Jesus had not lived, and<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>died on the cross, the story would have been the same. Crucify, crucify<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>—yes, everybody had to cry out. That outburst was true—it proved<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>that the crucifixion had happened, just as it was true about Venus. She<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>had lived, of course no one knew when, and she was dying now; she<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>couldn't rise again until she had died. Jesus was happier now—<lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>radiant. Where was the painter of a radiant Jesus? She had never<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>lost that sadness, for a gay Venus was a profanation. Botticelli ought<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>to have painted Jesus and Venus together: he could! It wouldn't be<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>a bit strange, no stranger than a black wren. An innocent mind <lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>A wonderful, wonderful thing, her body. Mary must be about<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>the same height, the same figure. Her face was different, not<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>pathetic; but it was only a mask, there must be a likeness hidden<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>within it. Not quite the same figure, though, for her shoulders were<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>spare, her arms thin; altogether she must be a little thinner than the<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>Venus. He oughtn't to be thinking thus of her. "Oughtn't I?<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>She doesn't know, and isn't it a kind of honour? The women who<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>were silent there were doing Jesus honour: thought is the only honour,<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>the purest. Was it wrong to paint the Botticelli Venus, or to look<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>at it? That's how I look at Mary now." But the crucifixion of<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>Jesus, of Venus—for once more only that or the prefiguration of it<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>could cause such sadness—but what had this to do with Mary?<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>He had lost the thread. Strange, though, that she should be called<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>Mary. How that Mary must have suffered! Did everything pure</ab>

Jesus as an old man, Venus an old woman—O what a<lb facs="P7_TL00004"/>disgusting thing a man's mind was.<lb facs="P7_TL00005"/>As disgusting was the thought of a black Venus—a black wren.<lb facs="P7_TL00006"/>What did Eleanor mean? Black—it was horrible. Black on white<lb facs="P7_TL00007"/>snow—but even bears and pigs weren't quite black: a grizzly gray,<lb facs="P7_TL00008"/>looking dark on the snow; pine trees in the distance, ridges of firs,<lb facs="P7_TL00009"/>weren't so black—nature, someone said, abhorred black. A black<lb facs="P7_TL00010"/>Venus—O evil, evil! No, grotesque; and he recalled an old music<lb facs="P7_TL00011"/>hall song, "I love my coal black Venus." These loathsome, vulgar<lb facs="P7_TL00012"/>things, once-heard never forgotten. Black Venus—the light sliding<lb facs="P7_TL00013"/>on a heaving black breast, leaden and smooth, shoulders with little<lb facs="P7_TL00014"/>pools of darkness between the black blades, the navel's blackness, the<lb facs="P7_TL00015"/>undimpled knees—horrible, horrible. Yet somewhere he'd heard<lb facs="P7_TL00016"/>of Jesus being translated black for the benefit of negroes. Wasn't<lb facs="P7_TL00017"/>that crucifying Him again, with a worse shame than ever? Must<lb facs="P7_TL00018"/>everything lovely be defiled, and then killed?<lb facs="P7_TL00019"/>When he was a boy—"l remember that Museum, ah yes. How<lb facs="P7_TL00020"/>old was I? not more than fifteen. Thirty years ago and more, and<lb facs="P7_TL00021"/>it's but yesterday. That glass case and several small things in it, and<lb facs="P7_TL00022"/>the bronze of a naked woman, a little bronze seven inches high. Yes,<lb facs="P7_TL00023"/>I was with the Adams, I remember now, and I was ashamed to stand<lb facs="P7_TL00024"/>looking at the figure and pretended to be looking at something else<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P7_TL00025"/>heaven knows what. I was ashamed, for I adored it. Nothing ever<lb facs="P7_TL00026"/>so beautiful, a joy to think of even now. O, men lust because they<lb facs="P7_TL00027"/>find nothing to love. I remember it all now, and I know. It was<lb facs="P7_TL00028"/>the same day, but afterwards, that we walked past the theaters,<lb facs="P7_TL00029"/>through Leicester Square, and so on; and those horrible posters of<lb facs="P7_TL00030"/>dancing leering girls—horrible. How could I think of my bronze<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>figure then, standing lonely, lovely, silent in the glass case?" Thirty<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>years ago and more, he reminded himself.<lb facs="P7_TL00033"/>Such figures had been dug out of Greece, Egypt, Italy, Mexico—<lb facs="P7_TL00034"/>adored everywhere. How could men live without adoration? Who<lb facs="P7_TL00035"/>made such figures? What lover drew, what artist modeled, what<lb facs="P7_TL00036"/>priest perfected them? Out of the earth they came, and their lovers<lb facs="P7_TL00037"/>and artists and myriad worshippers—all from the earth. A restless<lb facs="P7_TL00038"/>earth, seething with life, sinking into death, with perpetual succession<lb facs="P7_TL00039"/>of change and counterchange. Like a sea, heaving and sinking; and<lb facs="P7_TL00040"/>straightway his thought fled on to:—<lb facs="P7_TL00041"/>Love still hath something of the sea<lb facs="P7_TL00042"/>From whence his mother rose.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00002"/>Jesus walking upon the sea, trampling the storm until it was cowed<lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>and fled, and Venus rising tranquil from green waves. Her doves<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>flying out from the cliff-holes, pale doves, gray and pale; and black<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>diminutive birds, black wrens hovering about the edge and shrilling<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>their small sweet notes. The doves fled from Venus to Jesus and one<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>rested a moment on His head and He smiled; then it flew off and<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>circled above Venus, and all the doves fluttered at once. The black<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>wrens had gone—strange birds: he had never heard of them before;<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>evil birds, for all that was black was sinister. Their shrill song was but<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>a mockery— they had gone, but it still sprinkled the air with a faint<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>mocking echo. There was mocking round the Hill, women's thinner<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>voices mocking Jesus as He hung on the cross, and men's voices deep<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>as cattle. The women's eyes were black, their hair was black, their<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>gestures, words, laughter—all black and cruel and mocking. No<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>such mockery tainted the lily-fairness of this mild sad Venus. Sad,<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>but not suffering, in a lilied tranquillity. Invisible lilies oozed their<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>scent around her, wrapped her in their acrid sweetness; they were not<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>lilies that fester smelling far worse than weeds. O but they would<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>fester yet; rankness would subdue sweetness, the Venus lilies would<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>shake down in shrivelled petals. Venus herself, must she perish<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>too? Venus would fester, shrivel up and sink into dust; the flesh<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>could not endure. Only crucifixion could save it—wasn t that what<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>He meant when He said <lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>The handle rattled briskly and the door opened. "I don't know<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>what to do with that hen; she's eating her eggs again." He raised<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>his head and loomed vacantly out of his thoughts. What are you<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>talking about, Eleanor?"<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>She looked at him frowning. "Didn't I tell you, when you were<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>washing your hands just now, didn t I tell you I was going to see<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>about that hen, the black hen? I've thought a long time she's been<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>eating her eggs—but you take no notice. Why, it was only two<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>minutes ago."<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>Two minutes—no, surely hours ago, hours and hours. All this<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>had happened to him since then. "Of course, of course. Only, I'd<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>forgotten—thinking of something else." He smiled vaguely, as though<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>at his own thoughts; a characteristic smile.<lb facs="P8_TL00038"/>- But when Mary was sitting with them at tea the gray cloud that<lb facs="P8_TL00039"/>had lifted suddenly came upon him again, and his thoughts wandered<lb facs="P8_TL00040"/>off-—so wild and so foolish that it was too much trouble to watch<lb facs="P8_TL00041"/>them. Let them go. His wife was talking and Mary sitting almost</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P9_TL00002"/>silent. Looking at Mary he was amused to recall how, until now, he<lb facs="P9_TL00003"/>had always disliked fair hair and pale eyes. Mary's was fair, her<lb facs="P9_TL00004"/>eyes a little pale. She was thinner than the Venus, her shoulders<lb facs="P9_TL00005"/>were spare, but she was the same height and <lb facs="P9_TL00006"/>"Goodness, there's Cyril again," said his wife as there came a<lb facs="P9_TL00007"/>bump and a crying overhead; and she sprang up and Mary too.<lb facs="P9_TL00008"/>Mary stood between the french window and the door as his wife ran<lb facs="P9_TL00009"/>upstairs. The same height, the same figure, the same mask. In the<lb facs="P9_TL00010"/>hush of his wife's absence a great gulf opened. Across the gulf he<lb facs="P9_TL00011"/>stared at Mary, not seeing her. His thoughts flowed over her, and<lb facs="P9_TL00012"/>then as he looked up suddenly and gazed on her face, half illuminated<lb facs="P9_TL00013"/>by the falling sun, her consciousness of his gaze increased. She<lb facs="P9_TL00014"/>knew his look, and her face and neck flushed unbearably. He saw<lb facs="P9_TL00015"/>the flush and knew that it was all over her, head to feet; and he was<lb facs="P9_TL00016"/>ashamed and glad.

Was she but mortal<lb facs="P9_TL00034"/>flesh, a Venus only? Had the white pigeons flown towards her,<lb facs="P9_TL00035"/>baffled only by the window pane? "Good-bye, good-bye," he was<lb facs="P9_TL00036"/>saying, and a moment after watched her through the window—light<lb facs="P9_TL00037"/>and firm and a mystery— as she stepped into the road.<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>Then he opened the door murmuring, "I must go up and see if<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>it's still in Maggie's room."

Born of undiluted Yankee stock, diapered and weaned by none<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>but Yankee hands, the little gentleman was raised in the strict moral<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>traditions of his race. At a precocious age he entered the public school<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>where his persistent interest in every phase of human activity astonished<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>his fellow-pupils and instructors alike. Even at the age of thirteen<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>when his school mates were only interested in abusing him, the little<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>Joseph was already publishing a small review, "The Gleam," which<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>contained articles of literary and historical import.<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>Upon graduating from the Norwood High School, Mr. Gould<lb facs="P23_TL00015"/>commuted to Harvard College.

Mr. Gould vainly tried to enlist in the glorious<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>ranks of those fighting for world democracy, but being unable to pass<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>the physical requirements of the army he was obliged to forego that<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>pleasure.

If times are propitious a cigarette emitting clouds of<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>smoke wobbles loosely at the end of it. Immediately following the<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>bow-sprit, there appears a small sharp nose, or prow, on which a pair<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>of bent wire spectacles rests askew. This in turn is followed by a<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>sparse and goatish beard, a scraggly mustache, two singularly bright<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>eyes and finally an entire head crowned by an absurdly small pill-box<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>hat. Immediately beneath the head, in fact its only visible means of<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>support, one observes a long flopping overcoat which presumably<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>harbors within it some sort of vigorous little body which can and with<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>amazing rapidity propel the aforesaid overcoat through traffic and<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>around corners.

Humorous pedants have seen in this<lb facs="P62_TL00014"/>nothing more than an application of current homiletics, the "poor boy<lb facs="P62_TL00015"/>to president" stuff.

It is doubtful whether Dr. Thorndike himself<lb facs="P62_TL00017"/>has escaped from this attitude, wholly; but his book is so rich, is such<lb facs="P62_TL00018"/>a generous gathering of fascinating knowledge that he can be forgiven.<lb facs="P62_TL00019"/>In effect the book is a sequel to Frazer's Golden Bough in reveal<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
