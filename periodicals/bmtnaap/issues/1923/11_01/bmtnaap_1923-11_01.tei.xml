                                    <lb facs="P3_TL00005"/>Snow was falling. Not the white snow that falls in winter, but the tin<lb facs="P3_TL00006"/>snow that falls in New and Wall streets. It is a sparse and agitated snow,<lb facs="P3_TL00007"/>continually whipped into flurries by the wings of pigeons, tossed and tortured<lb facs="P3_TL00008"/>as it drifts downward until the lower winds of the street seize upon it and<lb facs="P3_TL00009"/>fling it back to the roofs. But sometimes as it flickers across the windows of<lb facs="P3_TL00010"/>the office buildings, a flake twisting to the proper angle catches the light<lb facs="P3_TL00011"/>of the sun.<lb facs="P3_TL00012"/>It was at precisely 11 :28 a.m. on the 1 7th of September, 1923 that one<lb facs="P3_TL00013"/>of these flakes turning as it fell, sent a tiny shaft of light into the left eye of<lb facs="P3_TL00014"/>Mr. Joseph J. Trackle. He, however, did not notice it. Leaning forward<lb facs="P3_TL00015"/>from the edge of his chair so that the torso of his body ran parallel to the<lb facs="P3_TL00016"/>floor, with his derby resting on the back of his head, with his left cheek glued<lb facs="P3_TL00017"/>to the glass breast of the sawed-off ticker, Mr. Trackle was far too immersed in<lb facs="P3_TL00018"/>quotations to receive the little message the flake of tin snow had so gently<lb facs="P3_TL00019"/>sent him from the sun.<lb facs="P3_TL00020"/>—The market is soggy, he whispered.<lb facs="P3_TL00021"/>Whereat the quotational pap which had faithfully fed him for more than<lb facs="P3_TL00022"/>thirty years, suddenly curdled. And thereafter the ticker maintained so<lb facs="P3_TL00023"/>absolute and dogged a silence that Mr. Trackle could hear his clerks mumble<lb facs="P3_TL00024"/>in the next room, or his watch tick in its little pocket over his appendix. After<lb facs="P3_TL00025"/>waiting for 67 seconds, and being no longer able to bear the silence, he<lb facs="P3_TL00026"/>began petulantly to yank and twitch at the tape. Whereupon the tape broke,<lb facs="P3_TL00027"/>as tapes do when they are yanked, and Mr. Trackle snarling to himself,<lb facs="P3_TL00028"/>slunk back into his chair, thrust his feet up on the ticker stand, shoved his<lb facs="P3_TL00029"/>derby forward over his eyes, and after performing a number of impatient<lb facs="P3_TL00030"/>flourishes in the upper left hand corner of a pad of paper, he wrote the<lb facs="P3_TL00031"/>following extemporaneous lyric:—<lb facs="P3_TL00032"/>A Rotten market.<lb facs="P3_TL00033"/>I have a head I have a head I have a headacke<lb facs="P3_TL00034"/>LV Love is all truth<lb facs="P3_TL00035"/>Call Schuyler 649% RBC is a good buy<lb facs="P3_TL00036"/>No more raw oysters for me.<lb facs="P3_TL00037"/>Schuyler 49% RBC 50% Rebecca Steel 52<lb facs="P3_TL00038"/>good by Miss Pearly<lb facs="P3_TL00039"/>4914 Rebec Mr. Mallet</ab>

For in splicing its lines, hauling up<lb facs="P4_TL00007"/>the incidents, memories and associations which produced them, by dredging,<lb facs="P4_TL00008"/>sounding and similarly employing ourselves, we may not only gain an insight<lb facs="P4_TL00009"/>upon the whirling fermentation of Mr. Trackle's pysche, but we may also<lb facs="P4_TL00010"/>give the poem an organization which it now seems superficially to lack.<lb facs="P4_TL00011"/>Let us therefore jump into the ring and start milling at once.<lb facs="P4_TL00012"/>Item I. A Rotten market<lb facs="P4_TL00013"/>The analyses of this phrase must begin with die following query:—Why<lb facs="P4_TL00014"/>should Mr. Trackle, having just previously used the adjective "soggy" to<lb facs="P4_TL00015"/>describe the unfortunate condition of the market, now use the word Rotten<lb facs="P4_TL00016"/>to describe it?<lb facs="P4_TL00017"/>As there are four answers to this question, I will tabulate them as<lb facs="P4_TL00018"/>follows:—<lb facs="P4_TL00019"/>A. The Subject (Mr. Trackle) did not use the word "soggy" to<lb facs="P4_TL00020"/>describe the unfortunate condition of the market for the precise reason that he<lb facs="P4_TL00021"/>had already used it. Like Shakespeare, he was loathe to repeat.<lb facs="P4_TL00022"/>B. The Subject did not use the word "soggy" for the reason that he<lb facs="P4_TL00023"/>did not know whether it should be spelled with or without an E. This lack<lb facs="P4_TL00024"/>of surety would have retarded the free velocity of his pencil and would have<lb facs="P4_TL00025"/>doubtless produced that conflict which led him into so much difficulty later on.<lb facs="P4_TL00026"/>C. The Subject chose the word Rotten because it began with an R,<lb facs="P4_TL00027"/>the majuscule of which he took a secret pleasure in writing.<lb facs="P4_TL00028"/>D. Rotten described the condition of the market as well, if not better,<lb facs="P4_TL00029"/>than the word "soggy."<lb facs="P4_TL00030"/>Item 11. I have a head I have a head I have a headache<lb facs="P4_TL00031"/>From the phrase A Rotten market to the sentence I have a head seems a<lb facs="P4_TL00032"/>wide and inexplicable leap on the part of Mr. Trackle's brain. But though<lb facs="P4_TL00033"/>it may be wide, it is certainly not inexplicable, as we will all see in a moment<lb facs="P4_TL00034"/>or two.<lb facs="P4_TL00035"/>It has already been noted that the word Rotten for dejastated reasons<lb facs="P4_TL00036"/>is the weightiest word in Item I. Such being the case it is natural that it<lb facs="P4_TL00037"/>should arouse from Our Subject's unconscious, certain images, ideas, and<lb facs="P4_TL00038"/>memories of a recent date. This was in fact true. For no sooner had Mr.<lb facs="P4_TL00039"/>Trackle's pencil produced the word Rotten, and even before it had completed<lb facs="P4_TL00040"/>the word market, there flashed into his mind a certain conversation he had<lb facs="P4_TL00041"/>held with his wife that morning before breakfast. The conversation was as<lb facs="P4_TL00042"/>follows:—</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P5_TL00002"/>—Good morning, my dear husband, said Mrs. Trackle as she stepped<lb facs="P5_TL00003"/>into her husband's bed-room clothed in nothing more than a Japanese kimono,<lb facs="P5_TL00004"/>a pair of mules, and a boudoir cap.<lb facs="P5_TL00005"/>—Are you in here again? replied Mr. Trackle who was lying in bed<lb facs="P5_TL00006"/>with the morning paper propped against his knees, while the valet arranged<lb facs="P5_TL00007"/>his breakfast beside him on a card table.<lb facs="P5_TL00008"/>—Why Joseykins my dear, exclaimed Mrs. Trackle, this is the first time<lb facs="P5_TL00009"/>this morning I've been in your room.<lb facs="P5_TL00010"/>—Did you ever see, asked Mr. Trackle of the valet, such a woman for<lb facs="P5_TL00011"/>bobbing in and out of a poyson's privacy ? Look at her, with her hair all down<lb facs="P5_TL00012"/>over her eyes. She hasn't even washed yet. I can see streaks of dirt all up<lb facs="P5_TL00013"/>and down her filthy face. Get out of here you lazy-good-for-nothings.<lb facs="P5_TL00014"/>Phew, you stink!<lb facs="P5_TL00015"/>—Controllez-voo, controllez, cried Mrs. Trackle, I've just been using a<lb facs="P5_TL00016"/>depillatory. But I came into see if my little Joseykins would like his wife to<lb facs="P5_TL00017"/>eat breakfast with him. -<lb facs="P5_TL00018"/>—Well, he wouldn't. Not on your life he wouldn't, with such a<lb facs="P5_TL00019"/>dishevelled fatwoman as that. Get outta here.<lb facs="P5_TL00020"/>Mrs. Trackle flickered out. But she had hardly closed the door behind<lb facs="P5_TL00021"/>her when<lb facs="P5_TL00022"/>—Isabel! shouted Mr. Trackle. Come back here. Pat, lead that<lb facs="P5_TL00023"/>woman back into my presence.<lb facs="P5_TL00024"/>Mrs. Trackle's nervous pastry face appeared again.<lb facs="P5_TL00025"/>—Isabel, whimpered Mr. Trackle, I didn't sleep a wink last night. I<lb facs="P5_TL00026"/>had such a TERRIBLE headache. I was tossing and turning in my bed<lb facs="P5_TL00027"/>all night long.<lb facs="P5_TL00028"/>—Well, said Mrs. Trackle oozing in through the door, if you will sit<lb facs="P5_TL00029"/>UP to three and four in the morning drinking cocktails<lb facs="P5_TL00030"/>—Is that all the sympathy I get after me tossing and turning in bed all<lb facs="P5_TL00031"/>night long? cried her husband. Is that what a loving wife should say to her<lb facs="P5_TL00032"/>husband when he hasn't slept a wink? Is that the sort of heartless fatty<lb facs="P5_TL00033"/>bumbums you are? A wife should be gentle, soft, and affable1) and not go<lb facs="P5_TL00034"/>around hello making disorder everywhere. She shouldn't breed disharmony,<lb facs="P5_TL00035"/>hello She should say to her husband, I'm so sorry Josey and is there anything<lb facs="P5_TL00036"/>I can do to alleviate you? But no. She wouldn't say that. SHE'S nothing<lb facs="P5_TL00037"/>but a nervous fatwoman. Pretty good, eh Pat?<lb facs="P5_TL00038"/>—Very good Sir, replied the valet.<lb facs="P5_TL00039"/>—But I AM sorry, Joseykins.<lb facs="P5_TL00040"/>—Will you stop screaming in that raucous manner? I'm not at the other<lb facs="P5_TL00041"/>end of a bowling alley.<lb facs="P5_TL00042"/>—O Josey, DO control yourself. Pat, I'll tell you.

Especially after<lb facs="P6_TL00011"/>such a night.<lb facs="P6_TL00012"/>—That's it, always criticizing. Did you ever see such a woman? My<lb facs="P6_TL00013"/>God, will I ever get rid of this impediment? That's what you are, you're<lb facs="P6_TL00014"/>an impediment.<lb facs="P6_TL00015"/>—Well Josey, replied the impediment, if jou keep this up I won't be.<lb facs="P6_TL00016"/>And you better remember what Dr. Rock said about alcohol and your<lb facs="P6_TL00017"/>blood pressure.<lb facs="P6_TL00018"/>—Dr. Rock's a sucker, replied Mr. Impediment Trackle. A cocktail or<lb facs="P6_TL00019"/>two can't disturb me. It's those damn oysters I ate. They rot in the<lb facs="P6_TL00020"/>intestines.<lb facs="P6_TL00021"/>Though the preceding conversation has been long, longer perhaps than<lb facs="P6_TL00022"/>I implied it would be some few pages back, it has nevertheless given us a<lb facs="P6_TL00023"/>clue, particularly in the words I have indicated by italics, to the correct<lb facs="P6_TL00024"/>association between Item I and Item 11.

                                    <lb facs="P6_TL00025"/>duced a flareback to the word rot in the conversation recorded above, thus<lb facs="P6_TL00026"/>precipitating upon the plane of Our Subject's conscious a vision of oysters<lb facs="P6_TL00027"/>putrefying in his intestines, so also did this vision in turn drag up the opinion<lb facs="P6_TL00028"/>(however specious) that his headache was alone due to the poisonous effect<lb facs="P6_TL00029"/>of these oysters upon his blood. He therefore wrote, I have a head; which<lb facs="P6_TL00030"/>though it was both literally and figuratively true, was not what he intended to<lb facs="P6_TL00031"/>write. For upon completing the first four letters of the fourth word; i.e. head,<lb facs="P6_TL00032"/>he was unable to remember whether to spell ache with aK or with an H. He<lb facs="P6_TL00033"/>therefore repeated the phrase in writing, but again found himself baffled.<lb facs="P6_TL00034"/>Again he tried, but suddenly recalling the word 'back-ache' and believing that<lb facs="P6_TL00035"/>there was some profound orthographical consanguinity between the two<lb facs="P6_TL00036"/>syllables of that word, he finally completed the sentence, misspelled as it now<lb facs="P6_TL00037"/>stands: I have a headache. Q.E.D.<lb facs="P6_TL00038"/>Item 111. LV<lb facs="P6_TL00039"/>Immediately after Our Subject had completed the second line of his<lb facs="P6_TL00040"/>poem, the ticker buzzed. As he was short of three or four thousand shares<lb facs="P6_TL00041"/>of LV (Lehigh Valley) and rather nervous about them, Item 111 merely<lb facs="P6_TL00042"/>expresses his conscious or unconscious wish to read their latest quotation on<lb facs="P6_TL00043"/>the tape.</ab>

Why not her name, her<lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>street address, her employment?<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>Why her telephone number? Because, my dear fellow, when Mr.<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>Trackle began dealing in terms of the Abstract, the Ideal, or the Prophetic,<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>his mind immediately attached itself, or became the mouth-piece of some<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>spectral telephone, at the receiving end of which God and His entire solar<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>system respectfully listened. We have already witnessed a manifestation of<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>this curious phenomenon in the conversation recorded under Item 11, wherein<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>Mr. Trackle while expanding upon the subject of the Ideal Wife, interspersed<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>his discourse with loud telephonic cries of 'hello!'

Nevertheless, such a relation existed, and the abstract<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>idea of Love sifting through Miss Pearly's lovely body, was finally voli<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Why the substitution of<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>for the last figure of Miss Pearly's number which we know should be merely 4?<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>This is more simple than appears on the surface. For Our Subject<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>having written Call Schuyler, and having just started to make the lower quirk<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>of the 6, certain inevitable fears began to assail him from all sides. These<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>fears sprang fully armed from the grim realization of his age, for Mr. Trackle<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>it must be understood, though I have not hitherto brought the student's atten<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

He was, on the contrary, a few years<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>more than 50, and for that reason not so tireless and sturdy a warrior in the<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>lists of Venus as, let us say, a dashing young blade of 25. This realization,<lb facs="P8_TL00028"/>having moreover a definite empirical basis, at once assumed so painfully<lb facs="P8_TL00029"/>dominating an aspect of Our Subject's relation to the little diving girl, that<lb facs="P8_TL00030"/>his mind in self-defense retreating from the Arena of Love to those fields of<lb facs="P8_TL00031"/>combat wherein age in no way hobbled his prowess, immediately galloped<lb facs="P8_TL00032"/>into the Stock Exchange. Whereupon he at once realized that the 49 in<lb facs="P8_TL00033"/>Miss Pearly's telephone number was significant only because, with the<lb facs="P8_TL00034"/>addition of a quarter, it represented the price he had paid for 500 shares of<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>Republic Iron and Steel ten minutes previously.<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>Item VI.

Your devoted husband, Felix COVENOL."<lb facs="P23_TL00007"/>When the female of the owl, after visiting minutely the grass-stalks of the<lb facs="P23_TL00008"/>clearing and the treacherous soil of swamps, comes beating its wings softly,<lb facs="P23_TL00009"/>comes like the baker's boy to find her young whose voices for hours past have<lb facs="P23_TL00010"/>sounded no longer in her ears, and for a good reason, the nest being destroyed,<lb facs="P23_TL00011"/>the owlets and the owl their father carried away:—when the female of the<lb facs="P23_TL00012"/>owl after vainly searching for her nest is obliged to realize the extent of her<lb facs="P23_TL00013"/>misfortune, and at first she is not willing, she rises moaning between the trees<lb facs="P23_TL00014"/>and higher than the custom of owls permits.

A wise prudence had always kept the<lb facs="P23_TL00032"/>mother of the cripple from sending her little Victor to school. Old peasant<lb facs="P23_TL00033"/>woman, she had not foreseen the science of Dolores and the vices of the<lb facs="P23_TL00034"/>deckhand! Observe how written words drive a path silently through the veins<lb facs="P23_TL00035"/>of limping Victor with his complexion the color of prunes. He parades his<lb facs="P23_TL00036"/>folly through the blossoming cherry orchards and his bleeding lips repeat:<lb facs="P23_TL00037"/>White, white, white. The clouds are young men's bodies swayed by the<lb facs="P23_TL00038"/>rolling of a ship.

                                    <lb facs="P24_TL00002"/>paste earrings and a coloured scarf. Then the peddler goes off with his knotted<lb facs="P24_TL00003"/>bandanna over his shoulder.<lb facs="P24_TL00004"/>What stranger has set his foot on Marmor Island? He wears soft shirts and<lb facs="P24_TL00005"/>his hair is as blue as ink. He passes in the midst of children at play; he<lb facs="P24_TL00006"/>smiles to little Eric, then to himself. He is seen crossing the public squares.<lb facs="P24_TL00007"/>In the countryside he is found motionless in the open places; he does not seem<lb facs="P24_TL00008"/>to be hunting points of view. Dolores is waiting for the cripple at the fountain.<lb facs="P24_TL00009"/>He tells her his secret. She shivers with joy. A project is expanding in his<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>breast, has reached his lips. Across fences the couple is watching, haggardly,<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>the colts which pursue each other and nibble at brown flanks. At the point<lb facs="P24_TL00012"/>of infinity parallel lines will meet at last. For purposes of convenience, infinity<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>is represented in a corner of the drawing pads which are used by school<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>children to copy from plaster copies Michael Angelo's slave, that living<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>scandal. But follow the twin thoughts of the lovers of Marmor Island; their<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>common point is not, as you might believe, this English daisy with edges<lb facs="P24_TL00017"/>lightly purpled. Nor is the English daisy their point of departure. Strangers,<lb facs="P24_TL00018"/>they have come together once more only because of their desire, only because<lb facs="P24_TL00019"/>of the object of their desire. And that object . . . how he is tranquil<lb facs="P24_TL00020"/>in the crow's nest where he rests, his sleeves rolled back, one arm round his<lb facs="P24_TL00021"/>forehead, the other hand clinging to a rope which mounts to bathe in the sky,<lb facs="P24_TL00022"/>while the sea air and the sun are happy to caress so tempting a flesh without<lb facs="P24_TL00023"/>falling into mortal sin! And you, my good Eugene Demolder, why do you<lb facs="P24_TL00024"/>toss your naive shoes against the ceiling of your hut? Here is what happened:<lb facs="P24_TL00025"/>as he was carrying the jewels, bought from the sale of his furniture, to his<lb facs="P24_TL00026"/>mistress, Eugene looked through the window and surprised the guilty intimacy<lb facs="P24_TL00027"/>of the cripple and Madame Covenol. In a bar near the docks the stranger<lb facs="P24_TL00028"/>watches Eugene, who drinks, drinks. Then he gives a little money for the<lb facs="P24_TL00029"/>privilege of retiring with a tall pale painted girl who wants to weep.<lb facs="P24_TL00030"/>Felix the deckhand dreams in the flanks of the ship. At last he knows<lb facs="P24_TL00031"/>what happens during a kiss on the mouth, this extraordinary voyage to the<lb facs="P24_TL00032"/>country of corals and luminous fishes. He will be emperor of the Indies. He<lb facs="P24_TL00033"/>is emperor of the Indies and king of Aurora. Aurora is a city with a soft<lb facs="P24_TL00034"/>skin, with easy morals, a city which glides into a background of palms. A<lb facs="P24_TL00035"/>bark among the reeds. What does the Queen say? It is the great fan which<lb facs="P24_TL00036"/>breathes, which caresses. Wakening. And you beside me. In a week we<lb facs="P24_TL00037"/>shall be on Marmor Island. You shall come with me. My wife will be glad.<lb facs="P24_TL00038"/>She is talking to Victor somewhere on the island, while Eugene spies on them<lb facs="P24_TL00039"/>from the shelter of a tree. The stranger is seen to pass, herborizing. He<lb facs="P24_TL00040"/>seeks huge ugly flowers, examines them under the microscope and places them,<lb facs="P24_TL00041"/>with a satisfied air, in the black tin box which hangs by a strap from his<lb facs="P24_TL00042"/>shoulder. Adolphe the cabin boy has begun to love his master and thinks of<lb facs="P24_TL00043"/>him when he washes his teeth. The man who makes the stars revolve when<lb facs="P24_TL00044"/>only his hand touches me. But there is no daisy on board ship to pluck petal<lb facs="P24_TL00045"/>by petal.</ab>

Near the docks there is<lb facs="P25_TL00004"/>one house which wakens before the others. A housewife begins to wash the<lb facs="P25_TL00005"/>tiles of the kitchen vigorously. They are in the shape of four-leafed clovers.<lb facs="P25_TL00006"/>To whom will they bring luck? Somewhere else the chambermaid of an inn<lb facs="P25_TL00007"/>is picking from her hair the bits of straw which escaped from her bolster.<lb facs="P25_TL00008"/>But it is a knife which Eugene is weighing. Excellent, honest Eugene.<lb facs="P25_TL00009"/>I have no time to reprove your morals. Dolores sleeps like a baby. On the<lb facs="P25_TL00010"/>deck Felix polishes his buttons and watches Adolphe, who yawns. The<lb facs="P25_TL00011"/>cripple inspects minutely the barrel of his rifle. A face has passed behind<lb facs="P25_TL00012"/>the window. Victor opens the door. Nobody: that's odd. The little girl<lb facs="P25_TL00013"/>who, seated for hours and hours at the foot of the huge sunflowers in her<lb facs="P25_TL00014"/>familial garden, has been stringing beads on a black cotton thread, taking<lb facs="P25_TL00015"/>care to alternate regularly the colours blue, yellow, white, green, lavender,<lb facs="P25_TL00016"/>orange, blue, yellow, white, suddenly remarks two white beads side by side<lb facs="P25_TL00017"/>in the middle of her long string. She breaks the thread for spite, the beads<lb facs="P25_TL00018"/>scatter, she cries. The goat comes to play with the little girl, crushes the beads,<lb facs="P25_TL00019"/>and the last word is said.<lb facs="P25_TL00020"/>About four o'clock in the afternoon, what magnificent weather, Dolores,<lb facs="P25_TL00021"/>standing on the threshold of her home, enjoys diabolically the drama which<lb facs="P25_TL00022"/>already is revolving round her smile. How she sniffs the air, how gaily she<lb facs="P25_TL00023"/>hums! She has crossed her hands behind her neck. On one road, the fury<lb facs="P25_TL00024"/>of the deckhand. On another, the terror of the cabin boy. The highways of<lb facs="P25_TL00025"/>the island will not be bored this night. Once more the lightning of a rifle in<lb facs="P25_TL00026"/>the underbrush. The stranger steps out of the Decorated-Swan. You have<lb facs="P25_TL00027"/>chosen a strange moment, Eugene, to come to reproach the woman who mocks<lb facs="P25_TL00028"/>you. She offers you wine. Don't stare at her throat in this fashion, unfortunate<lb facs="P25_TL00029"/>man. A caress wins every argument. Against whom has this hand been armed,<lb facs="P25_TL00030"/>this hand which only thought of twisting a woman's wrist? Transparent<lb facs="P25_TL00031"/>fingers of Dolores, pointing out the road to the mountain. Where is the deck<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P25_TL00032"/>hand? I heard cries, I thought I recognized the voice of Adolphe. Girls pass<lb facs="P25_TL00033"/>singing, arms round each other's waists, those at the two ends playing with<lb facs="P25_TL00034"/>their aprons. What is there red on this leaf? What is there moaning near<lb facs="P25_TL00035"/>the fountain? I warned you, traveller. A few flies circle. The report of a<lb facs="P25_TL00036"/>rifle and this flame. . . I have seen gunshots in old lithographs. The stranger<lb facs="P25_TL00037"/>is seated on a heap of stones; with the tip of his cane he designs the sex of<lb facs="P25_TL00038"/>man and the sex of woman in the dust. He rises and speaks to the road mender,<lb facs="P25_TL00039"/>who shifts his cap on his head to answer. Broom will flower as long as there<lb facs="P25_TL00040"/>are lovers in the world. In the flowering broom of the mountainside, Felix is<lb facs="P25_TL00041"/>suspended by death. Horrible wounds. The head is almost detached from<lb facs="P25_TL00042"/>the trunk, the body is hacked in more than thirty places. A little yellow flower<lb facs="P25_TL00043"/>has fallen lugubriously into the wound of his neck. I have seen this knife in<lb facs="P25_TL00044"/>the hands of Eugene. Eugene! Only the echo answers, Gene! The ball<lb facs="P25_TL00045"/>entered his back at the point indicated by a cross and he tumbled into the</ab>

Poor, poor Eugene Demolder, now your body is only a little bouquet<lb facs="P26_TL00003"/>of gilly-flowers in the middle of the silex. It wasn't worth the trouble. And yet<lb facs="P26_TL00004"/>you were not a disagreeable spot in the landscape, with your little waxed<lb facs="P26_TL00005"/>moustache. We shall speak of you no more.<lb facs="P26_TL00006"/>Around a billiard table already weary (it is a long time since an awkward<lb facs="P26_TL00007"/>player paid sixty francs for the first tear, the tear that left the first angular<lb facs="P26_TL00008"/>scar in the cloth), the cashier, the proprietor of the cafe, two or three clients,<lb facs="P26_TL00009"/>one of whom holds his seidel to keep it from flying away, the smiling partner,<lb facs="P26_TL00010"/>the impatient adversaries, a soldier who no longer carries his pipe to his lips—<lb facs="P26_TL00011"/>it will go out—, all of them animated by different sentiments, watch the<lb facs="P26_TL00012"/>fortunate player who is making a run. Where is the cripple? It is his turn.<lb facs="P26_TL00013"/>"How did you tear your clothes, Adolphe?" asks Dolores, but the pale cabin<lb facs="P26_TL00014"/>boy shakes his head, full of the horrible death agony of the cripple, and does<lb facs="P26_TL00015"/>not reply. He looks at his clawed hands, and hides them from his eyes. I<lb facs="P26_TL00016"/>begin to understand the joy of the animals which crawl over the infirm earth.<lb facs="P26_TL00017"/>Another billiard; in the adjoining room the child of Dolores lies stifled in its<lb facs="P26_TL00018"/>cradle. It never recognized the knee which weighted down its breast.<lb facs="P26_TL00019"/>Unfortunate mother, how can one fail to pity her? The punishment is too<lb facs="P26_TL00020"/>great. Yes? But rather observe Dolores: she doesn't give a rip. She draws<lb facs="P26_TL00021"/>Adolphe into her arms, her fingers penetrate the tears in his garments, and<lb facs="P26_TL00022"/>now the machinery is once more in operation.<lb facs="P26_TL00023"/>Did you hear the branches crackle? Like broom, primroses are yellow.<lb facs="P26_TL00024"/>When I studied the catechism, I was given the dance of mosquitoes over the<lb facs="P26_TL00025"/>marshes as proof of the existence of God: against all probability, these little<lb facs="P26_TL00026"/>beasts do not tangle their feet. The mysterious stranger enters the cabin of<lb facs="P26_TL00027"/>Dolores and surprises the embraces of the woman and the child. "I know<lb facs="P26_TL00028"/>everything," he says, and once more the lovers tremble. This time, this time,<lb facs="P26_TL00029"/>behold, the vengeance of the skies! Not at all. There are, thank God, peoole<lb facs="P26_TL00030"/>_ A &gt;<lb facs="P26_TL00031"/>beyond the reach of your God. Have you seen Dolores, how she is lovely<lb facs="P26_TL00032"/>with her hair undone? The stranger reassures the couple, he begins to<lb facs="P26_TL00033"/>undress, he speaks his name: Ludovic. Adolphe and Dolores exchange a<lb facs="P26_TL00034"/>long regard. Ludovic folds open the sheets and glides his body, so cold, so<lb facs="P26_TL00035"/>thin, between the two warm bodies, which he caresses, and which in the<lb facs="P26_TL00036"/>falling night (all the plants of the island have grown rigid and all the insects<lb facs="P26_TL00037"/>have turned over on their backs) suddenly begin to howl with pleasure.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P28_TL00007"/>I was standing on a busy corner waiting for a street car and smoking a<lb facs="P28_TL00008"/>cigarette in one of the world's largest cities, and while standing there a woman<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>walked up to me and said, "Excuse me, and could you please tell me the time<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>if you know what it is?" I told her the time of day it was. She said, "Thank<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>you. And then she said, "I have been strolling around this corner for quite<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>some little time and it is late. I must go, and would you please mind letting<lb facs="P28_TL00013"/>me have ten cents for car fare as I came away without any money. Had that<lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>party showed up it would have been allright and I would not be asking<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>you for it."<lb facs="P28_TL00016"/>I sized it up. This was a trap of her's, an excuse to get to talking in<lb facs="P28_TL00017"/>asking me the time of day it was. I liked her looks and did not have ten cents<lb facs="P28_TL00018"/>in change and so I gave her a quarter. She smiled sweetly and even blushed<lb facs="P28_TL00019"/>and said, "I thank you." Just then a car came along and she got on and as<lb facs="P28_TL00020"/>the next car that came along was my car, I got on and all the way home I<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>had this accident on my mind and it set me to thinking of some of the many<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>varied past and strange experiences I have had with women asking me ques<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>tions on the street. Also with flirts and street walkers and quite a few I have<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>come in contact with. Somehow another in this case it seemed odd, unusual.<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>There was a strange feeling about it, why I don't know.<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>I had forgotten about the accident, and about three weeks after this I was<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>down town and this woman came into my mind. As I was walking along<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>the street and came to the corner, this woman also turned the corner. She<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>came up to me and said, "You are the gentleman I asked the time of day and<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>also asked you for ten cents car fare and you gave me a quarter about three<lb facs="P28_TL00031"/>weeks ago." I said, "Yes, you are right, lam the party." The nerve of her<lb facs="P28_TL00032"/>did not surprise me for this is what she then said, "Well," she said, "that was<lb facs="P28_TL00033"/>only a bluff of mine to get to talking with you and I cut short in my talk when<lb facs="P28_TL00034"/>I saw you were not that kind of a man who would fall for my game. And so<lb facs="P28_TL00035"/>I thought I would try and make it look to you I was decent and respectable."<lb facs="P28_TL00036"/>"Well," she says,"I am that way and the other way too. I like to have a<lb facs="P28_TL00037"/>good time on the side." And she said, "I bet you do too." I said, "Well, it<lb facs="P28_TL00038"/>all depends and I think you are right about it in this case." Then she said,<lb facs="P28_TL00039"/>"Where are you going this evening?" I said, "No place in particular." I<lb facs="P28_TL00040"/>never told her I was married and that my wife was away on a visit to her</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P29_TL00002"/>sister's. "Well," she saicl, "let's take a walk." I said, "Yes, sure I am<lb facs="P29_TL00003"/>with you." So we strolled along until we came to a park, went in and sat<lb facs="P29_TL00004"/>down on a bench. It got late, around eleven o'clock and I suggested that we<lb facs="P29_TL00005"/>go over to the corner saloon that had a side entrance for women. She said,<lb facs="P29_TL00006"/>"You beat me to it, I was just going to say the same to you."<lb facs="P29_TL00007"/>We went over and in. We had a glass of beer and several more beers<lb facs="P29_TL00008"/>followed. Then she said, "I must go, and could you meet me here tomorrow<lb facs="P29_TL00009"/>night?" I said, "Yes, I would do so." We went out and I wanted to get<lb facs="P29_TL00010"/>on the same car with her. She said, "Do me a favor and let me go by myself."<lb facs="P29_TL00011"/>I did so, having sized it up she did not want me to follow her maybe to see<lb facs="P29_TL00012"/>where she lived. I got on the next car and thought maybe she might be<lb facs="P29_TL00013"/>bluffing me about meeting her there the next evening. I sort of made up my<lb facs="P29_TL00014"/>mind not to be there, but I was kind of stuck on her. She had beautiful<lb facs="P29_TL00015"/>dreamy blue eyes and it was the shade or glow of purple in them that seemed<lb facs="P29_TL00016"/>to charm me or hold me in working for more of her company. And this in<lb facs="P29_TL00017"/>spite of me trying to wish I had never saw her or else wishing I had met her<lb facs="P29_TL00018"/>long before I did. There was something about her I cant explain. Her dark<lb facs="P29_TL00019"/>lovely titian hair also got a hold on my nerves. I'll say she was my kind and<lb facs="P29_TL00020"/>she was my style. There seemed to be something funny, odd or queer about<lb facs="P29_TL00021"/>the whole thing of this affair.<lb facs="P29_TL00022"/>Well, I met her the next evening early and we sat in there all evening<lb facs="P29_TL00023"/>until twelve o'clock. She said to me that evening, "I used to be kind of<lb facs="P29_TL00024"/>sporty, but cut it out. lam a married woman. My husband knows nothing<lb facs="P29_TL00025"/>of my past. He is a traveling salesman and is away most of the time. My<lb facs="P29_TL00026"/>husband is a good man. He is good to me, but the devil is in me yet. I had<lb facs="P29_TL00027"/>to get back into some of my old ways again." We left each other that night<lb facs="P29_TL00028"/>as we did the night before. She would not let me on the same car. We got<lb facs="P29_TL00029"/>on different cars. I was to meet her the next evening at 9 o'clock on a street<lb facs="P29_TL00030"/>corner in another part of the city quite some ways out. Again I had my<lb facs="P29_TL00031"/>doubts, thinking she might be bluffing me. I made up my mind to see this<lb facs="P29_TL00032"/>thing through and it was something about her wonderful blue and purple eyes<lb facs="P29_TL00033"/>that seemed to hold me into this game and I have doubts if there is another<lb facs="P29_TL00034"/>woman in the world that has eyes like her's were.<lb facs="P29_TL00035"/>Next evening I was on the corner at 9 o'clock where I was to meet her.<lb facs="P29_TL00036"/>She was not there. I waited for about five minutes and said to myself, "Bet<lb facs="P29_TL00037"/>it's a bluff this time." I looked up the street and saw a woman turn the corner<lb facs="P29_TL00038"/>walking rather fast towards me. I said, "That's her." It was, she came up<lb facs="P29_TL00039"/>to me and said, "I know you'll forgive me. lam awful sorry I kept you<lb facs="P29_TL00040"/>waiting." I said, "Oh, that's allright, I would be willing to wait here for<lb facs="P29_TL00041"/>you, well, until you just come." She laughed and said, "Yes, I believe you.<lb facs="P29_TL00042"/>I bet you would." She said, "Well, we will walk and stroll around this<lb facs="P29_TL00043"/>evening." We walked along talking about various things, turning in and out<lb facs="P29_TL00044"/>several streets. I was so interested in her I never paid any attention to where<lb facs="P29_TL00045"/>we were walking or what street we were on.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00002"/>While walking along she caught hold of my arm and said, "Let's walk a<lb facs="P30_TL00003"/>little slower as I wish to say something to you. lam going to tell you some<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P30_TL00004"/>thing." She said, "The reason I did not let you come or bring me home was<lb facs="P30_TL00005"/>I did not want you to see where I lived. I wanted to make sure you were<lb facs="P30_TL00006"/>different from all other men I have ever met. I saw and find you to be such."<lb facs="P30_TL00007"/>She said, "You are so wonderful, different and there is only two men in the<lb facs="P30_TL00008"/>world that I am willing to trust and that is my husband and you, but neither<lb facs="P30_TL00009"/>of you can trust me because there is a serpent in me. You know it but my<lb facs="P30_TL00010"/>husband dont." Then she said, "I live up the street here and I would like<lb facs="P30_TL00011"/>you to come home with me to my apartments." She said, "It will be allright."<lb facs="P30_TL00012"/>I said, "Is this straight?" She said, "Yes, I assure you it will be allright.<lb facs="P30_TL00013"/>It is safe and you have no reason to be afraid or have the least fear. My<lb facs="P30_TL00014"/>husband is in a western city and will not be home for ten days." I said,<lb facs="P30_TL00015"/>"Allright, I'll take your word for it that everything is O. K."<lb facs="P30_TL00016"/>We walked along and came to a house. She said, "I live here." As we<lb facs="P30_TL00017"/>walked up the steps I hesitated, but some kind of an impulse seemed to be<lb facs="P30_TL00018"/>drawing me on. She opened her hand bag and took out a latch key. We<lb facs="P30_TL00019"/>stepped into the place and she turned on the lights and then she bolted the<lb facs="P30_TL00020"/>door on the inside. We walked into the parlor. I took off my hat and laid<lb facs="P30_TL00021"/>it on the table. She removed her hat and coat and put them on a chair. Then<lb facs="P30_TL00022"/>she sat down on the sofa.<lb facs="P30_TL00023"/>I sat on a chair in front of her and said, "What did you mean when you<lb facs="P30_TL00024"/>said there is only two men you could trust but neither can trust you because as<lb facs="P30_TL00025"/>you said there is a serpent in you?" She said, "I mean this. You, I know<lb facs="P30_TL00026"/>have had a lot of experience in life and I know men I can read them like a<lb facs="P30_TL00027"/>book, and most all men are alike and, of course, you know there are exceptions<lb facs="P30_TL00028"/>to all things, but in the case of men, they are all alike except a few and the<lb facs="P30_TL00029"/>few are so different, like day and night. Now, I told you quite a little about<lb facs="P30_TL00030"/>myself and when I said that neither you nor my husband can trust me. You<lb facs="P30_TL00031"/>know you cant from what you see and know about me, you know it from<lb facs="P30_TL00032"/>experience in life and as to my husband, if he knew a little of what you know<lb facs="P30_TL00033"/>he also would know that he could not trust me. So, that is what I meant when<lb facs="P30_TL00034"/>I said there was a serpent in me, and there is too. But in a case like mine<lb facs="P30_TL00035"/>if any harm comes to any one it will be to me, not to others." I said, "Yes,<lb facs="P30_TL00036"/>I understand you." But I lied to her, I did not understand her for I could not<lb facs="P30_TL00037"/>quite get next to her explanation, and besides I sized it up she was a poor<lb facs="P30_TL00038"/>judge of reading men like a book as she said. I had some ideas of my own<lb facs="P30_TL00039"/>and kept certain things to myself because I was anxious to see this matter<lb facs="P30_TL00040"/>through, the outcome of it, and I was careful not to make any bad cracks for<lb facs="P30_TL00041"/>fear she would dismiss me too soon. We got to talking about various things<lb facs="P30_TL00042"/>and she told me her name and age. Her given name was like one that is<lb facs="P30_TL00043"/>famous in history and her age was around that period where a woman enjoys<lb facs="P30_TL00044"/>at her best life the passions of love wanting to love and be loved, thrills, excite<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

I looked<lb facs="P31_TL00006"/>with interest at one of her's and said, "How good looking you were when you<lb facs="P31_TL00007"/>had this picture taken." This was a bluff of mine, for she looked better to<lb facs="P31_TL00008"/>me then than she did in the picture. I did not wish to let her know it too soon<lb facs="P31_TL00009"/>that I was stuck on her. She said, "Look at me now. Cant you tell the<lb facs="P31_TL00010"/>difference?" I said, "Very little change from the picture and the way you<lb facs="P31_TL00011"/>look now, and of course you were dressed different and that accounts a<lb facs="P31_TL00012"/>whole lot in making the looks of you now and when you had this picture<lb facs="P31_TL00013"/>taken." She was playing her game and I was playing my game. She said,<lb facs="P31_TL00014"/>"Well, others have told me different and I thought different myself." I said<lb facs="P31_TL00015"/>to her, "Well, you told me I knew a lot and have had experiences in life and<lb facs="P31_TL00016"/>you got it right about me there, and might I say I am a pretty good judge of<lb facs="P31_TL00017"/>human nature and looks, and you look as good to me now as you did when you<lb facs="P31_TL00018"/>had that picture taken." She said, "Well, I believe you and what others have<lb facs="P31_TL00019"/>said about me they were sore or jealous at me and about me and I truly think<lb facs="P31_TL00020"/>from your talk I look as good myself now as I did when I had that picture taken,<lb facs="P31_TL00021"/>and it was imagination on my part in thinking the way I did and listening to<lb facs="P31_TL00022"/>what others said." She said, "You make me feel so good, come here, I'll tell<lb facs="P31_TL00023"/>you something, I wish to whisper it in your ear." I leaned over and she kissed<lb facs="P31_TL00024"/>me. Of course, I kissed her back.<lb facs="P31_TL00025"/>We were sitting close together. I got up and sat down in her lap and<lb facs="P31_TL00026"/>kissed her again and again several times, and then threw my arms around her<lb facs="P31_TL00027"/>and was loving and hugging her close and tight to me. Both of us were kissing<lb facs="P31_TL00028"/>each other. I was looking into her dreamy purple blue eyes and I said, "You<lb facs="P31_TL00029"/>have quite a few freckles on your face." She said, "Yes, I have. I wish I<lb facs="P31_TL00030"/>could get rid of them. I have tried so many different things. They kind of<lb facs="P31_TL00031"/>disappear, but come back." I said, "Well, let them alone they look fine to<lb facs="P31_TL00032"/>me. This is just what I love, freckles, blue eyes and red hair." She said,<lb facs="P31_TL00033"/>"I kind of think you love me a little." I said, "A little, well its more than a<lb facs="P31_TL00034"/>little. I love you a whole lot." So we kissed and hugged each other again.<lb facs="P31_TL00035"/>Then I said, "Bet I am heavy sitting on your lap, let's change, you sit on<lb facs="P31_TL00036"/>mine." So we changed positions. Then she threw her arms around me and<lb facs="P31_TL00037"/>started to squeeze me so hard I told her about it. She threw her leg up over the<lb facs="P31_TL00038"/>arm of the chair showing her bare knee. I said, "O, gee whiz, what an awful<lb facs="P31_TL00039"/>pretty leg you have." She said, "Yes, I have been told that I have pretty<lb facs="P31_TL00040"/>legs and arms, and what do you think of it, I have been told I would make<lb facs="P31_TL00041"/>a fine artist's model." I agreed with her and said, "Yes, I bet you would and<lb facs="P31_TL00042"/>do you know it that the finest artist's models in the world are in factories and<lb facs="P31_TL00043"/>offices. Rats on the society and rich stuff." She laughed and said, "You<lb facs="P31_TL00044"/>sure are a philosopher and you said something." Then I said, "I'll bet I can<lb facs="P31_TL00045"/>guess what size stocking you wear." She said, "All, right, what size do I</ab>

She<lb facs="P32_TL00006"/>said, "I don't know, I'll give it up." I said, "Because one would like to see<lb facs="P32_TL00007"/>it clear up. I know I would." She laughed and said "thats right, thats a<lb facs="P32_TL00008"/>good one." She then squeezed me again and started kissing me. I done the<lb facs="P32_TL00009"/>same to her.<lb facs="P32_TL00010"/>Then she said, "O, yes, let me show you my rooms. We have four<lb facs="P32_TL00011"/>rooms." We went from the parlor into the dining room and then in the<lb facs="P32_TL00012"/>kitchen. We came back into the dining room and then she went into another<lb facs="P32_TL00013"/>room from the dining room. She turned on the light, it was a bedroom. I<lb facs="P32_TL00014"/>stepped into the room. She turned to me and said, "Do you truly mean it<lb facs="P32_TL00015"/>when you said you love me a whole lot?" I said, "Yes, I truly do mean it."<lb facs="P32_TL00016"/>She threw her arms around me and said, "I believe you."<lb facs="P32_TL00017"/>We were standing there in embrace when suddenly the lights went out<lb facs="P32_TL00018"/>all over the apartment. Instantly it seemed as if we were in another world or<lb facs="P32_TL00019"/>strange place. It was pitch dark, but we could still see each other. She gave<lb facs="P32_TL00020"/>a little scream and said, "O where are we?" She reached out her hand and<lb facs="P32_TL00021"/>took mine and said, "Come, with me we must get out of this place." So I<lb facs="P32_TL00022"/>followed holding her hand. She came to something that had a black shining<lb facs="P32_TL00023"/>form. It was a queer place we were in. We could see the thing but could<lb facs="P32_TL00024"/>not see anything away from it. It was like being able to see ourselves but not<lb facs="P32_TL00025"/>anything away from ourselves. It was something moving in motion or alive.<lb facs="P32_TL00026"/>This form we saw was moving and kept in her way. She let go of my hand,<lb facs="P32_TL00027"/>stood still and looked around at me with a wild scared look in her eyes. She<lb facs="P32_TL00028"/>changed all over, seemed to age quick. She shook and trembled and said,<lb facs="P32_TL00029"/>"Let's walk around it." I followed her and we got around it and walked<lb facs="P32_TL00030"/>on. I was now walking by her side when we came to another black shining<lb facs="P32_TL00031"/>thing. It was moving and different from what we saw before. We stopped<lb facs="P32_TL00032"/>and looked at it. It seemed to be something like an elephant that had two<lb facs="P32_TL00033"/>heads on each side or end of it and it had funny looking legs. It walked<lb facs="P32_TL00034"/>awful funny. Fear in me kept me from laughing. Part would walk forward<lb facs="P32_TL00035"/>and then backwards, then it would stop and this movement would be reversed.<lb facs="P32_TL00036"/>Seemed as if the thing was trying to pull itself apart or separate itself for it<lb facs="P32_TL00037"/>was two things in one. She said, "O, I am so scared, what can those things<lb facs="P32_TL00038"/>be we saw?" I was commencing to feel kind of creepy or sort of scared<lb facs="P32_TL00039"/>myself and I said, "I dont know." And she said, "I wonder where we are."<lb facs="P32_TL00040"/>And I said, "I dont know that either. You got me in here and I dont know<lb facs="P32_TL00041"/>where I am." Then she said, "Well, I have got to get out of here and let you<lb facs="P32_TL00042"/>out too. You will have to follow me as you followed me into the room."<lb facs="P32_TL00043"/>I said, "All right, I'll follow you." She said, "Well, come on then." So<lb facs="P32_TL00044"/>we started walking on again. Again we came to a black shining form. This<lb facs="P32_TL00045"/>thing looked something like an alligator and it had an awful ugly looking</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P33_TL00002"/>mouth. We started to walk around it but it would walk in our way. She<lb facs="P33_TL00003"/>said, "It is strange these things dont seem to harm us." I said, "Well, no<lb facs="P33_TL00004"/>doubt it is because we are not harming them." We started another way to<lb facs="P33_TL00005"/>walk around it but it would still walk in our way opening and snapping its<lb facs="P33_TL00006"/>big long jaws.<lb facs="P33_TL00007"/>She turned around to me and said, "I wonder what has happened. O,<lb facs="P33_TL00008"/>God, what has happened and where are we." She gave me an awful look.<lb facs="P33_TL00009"/>All her beauty was gone. Her face was wrinkled, her eyes had changed to<lb facs="P33_TL00010"/>green and red. I got to feeling awful funny but was not afraid. It seemed in<lb facs="P33_TL00011"/>this strange place or another world or whatever it was that there was some<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P33_TL00012"/>thing about it that was holding me together and sort of keeping me my natural<lb facs="P33_TL00013"/>self. She said, "What can that thing be? We must get past it, so let's try<lb facs="P33_TL00014"/>again." I said, "All right, let's go." So we started again. The beast went<lb facs="P33_TL00015"/>back and forth and we could not get past it. She turned around and with a<lb facs="P33_TL00016"/>heavy gasp said, "O I thought you were gone and was not here with me."<lb facs="P33_TL00017"/>She said, "You wont leave me will you?" I said, "No, never will I leave<lb facs="P33_TL00018"/>you until }'ou get me out of here, and then it will be best for us to part as we<lb facs="P33_TL00019"/>are both to blame, you more so than myself. You see, lam only telling you<lb facs="P33_TL00020"/>the truth. You got me in here and lam depending on you to get me out of<lb facs="P33_TL00021"/>here." She said, "Well, stay with me, I'll get you out." I said, "All right."<lb facs="P33_TL00022"/>So we tried again to walk past the beast, but the thing kept in our way. I said,<lb facs="P33_TL00023"/>"Let's go back the other way." She said, "All right."<lb facs="P33_TL00024"/>We walked on and suddenly came to an incline that went down like a<lb facs="P33_TL00025"/>hill. It got steeper and steeper and suddenly we both commenced to skate or<lb facs="P33_TL00026"/>slide. It was smooth but rough. We took hold of each other's hands. It got<lb facs="P33_TL00027"/>steeper and steeper and all at a sudden we found ourselves it seemed as if<lb facs="P33_TL00028"/>floating in air or space. We went off the edge of the incline or else the incline<lb facs="P33_TL00029"/>disappeared from under our feet. She said, "Hold on tight to my hand." I<lb facs="P33_TL00030"/>said, "Sure I will." She looked at me and said, "I kind of feel a little better,<lb facs="P33_TL00031"/>this floating in space feels more free." She looked at me again and said,<lb facs="P33_TL00032"/>"O, what can this be. You dont look a bit scared and lam awful afraid in<lb facs="P33_TL00033"/>spite of feeling a little better." Oh, but she had changed and for the first time<lb facs="P33_TL00034"/>I told her how she looked and said, "I dont know what it can be unless it is<lb facs="P33_TL00035"/>because of you being scared has changed you." She said, "I cant help it and<lb facs="P33_TL00036"/>you wont leave me will you." I said, "Never, and please dont ask me again."<lb facs="P33_TL00037"/>She said, "All right, I wont ask you again, but we must get out of here."<lb facs="P33_TL00038"/>It seemed as if we floated here and there in all directions, not knowing if we<lb facs="P33_TL00039"/>were going any place at all, and all at a sudden we started going in one<lb facs="P33_TL00040"/>direction and it seemed an awful long time this way and that it would never<lb facs="P33_TL00041"/>stop or end, this floating or traveling in space pitch dark, but we could see<lb facs="P33_TL00042"/>each other just like in a lighted room or broad day light. It was a queer<lb facs="P33_TL00043"/>funny thing about it. Being dark and seeing we could see each other, but<lb facs="P33_TL00044"/>nothing away from each other.</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P34_TL00002"/>Floating on, we got into what seemed to be like a draft or suction that<lb facs="P34_TL00003"/>took us in its whirl or drew us along or else it seemed as if we were going<lb facs="P34_TL00004"/>faster and we went like this it seemed for a long time and we saw in front of<lb facs="P34_TL00005"/>us a light with kind of a red dull glow, and it seemed as if we were going<lb facs="P34_TL00006"/>faster and faster towards it, and it seemed as if it was years and years. I<lb facs="P34_TL00007"/>looked at her and she was so changed I could hardly tell it was a woman or<lb facs="P34_TL00008"/>mummy-like form as she looked like last. I felt kind of queer and funny at<lb facs="P34_TL00009"/>times and thought I was changing into some kind of a form. I was going to<lb facs="P34_TL00010"/>ask her several times how I looked and if I was changing. Whenever I was<lb facs="P34_TL00011"/>on the point of asking her it seemed as if there was something that kept me<lb facs="P34_TL00012"/>from asking her as I could not form or speak the words to ask her. I even<lb facs="P34_TL00013"/>wondered why was this so and it seemed as if something was trying to tell<lb facs="P34_TL00014"/>me not to tell her anything more about how she was changing and had<lb facs="P34_TL00015"/>changed. Somehow another I dont know what it was that made me keep<lb facs="P34_TL00016"/>looking at her as she seemed to be changing or aging so fast and appearing<lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>to be getting into a strange form something like on the order of the forms<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>we saw. As I looked at her again, I then thought of how beautiful she was<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>when I first met her.<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>The draft or suction we were in also seemed to be sort of changing or<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>else we were going faster, and she said, "This does seem strange this draft<lb facs="P34_TL00022"/>that seems to be taking us towards that red light." And she said, "Maybe<lb facs="P34_TL00023"/>we will get out this way." The light seemed to get bigger and as we went<lb facs="P34_TL00024"/>towards it we started to feel it getting warm or was it heat. Then again we<lb facs="P34_TL00025"/>started to get around ugly looking forms of different things going in the same<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>direction we were. Some were going faster than we were, passing us, others<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>getting near to us then seemed to slack up or get behind us. The heat was<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>getting stronger and she said, "We must go back." I said, "We cant." We<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>tried to twist ourselves thinking we could get out of this suction. We were<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>now by ourselves, all the forms were gone, and pretty soon we came into<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>forms or things again going the same way, all different, no two alike. They<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>acted like before, some got ahead of us and others slacked up behind. It<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>seemed as if we were now going faster and faster and the heat was getting hot<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>and hotter, and we could see it was a great fire ahead of us, boiling mountain,<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>waves lashing and leaping, rolling, chasing around in all directions and to<lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>describe it better, it was a storm of fire in a fire, an awful sight. We could<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>hear a different sound or roar besides the suction of what seemed like wind or<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>a draft.<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>I said to her, "Seems as if we are going into that fire." She said, "It<lb facs="P34_TL00040"/>surely does." I then looked at her and for the first time I felt real fear. She<lb facs="P34_TL00041"/>had changed so. Then I said to her, "I wish to make a cigarette as I have<lb facs="P34_TL00042"/>not had a smoke since you got me into this place and what ever it is I dont<lb facs="P34_TL00043"/>know, and so I'll have to let go of your hand to make a cigarette." She said,<lb facs="P34_TL00044"/>"Please dont let go of my hand and make a cigarette." She said,<lb facs="P34_TL00045"/>"Remember your promise to stay by me." Again I told her I was going to</ab>

I said, "Good-bye," and let go of her hand. She went from<lb facs="P35_TL00004"/>me quick and I saw her form go into that roaring furnace of storming fire and<lb facs="P35_TL00005"/>then suddenly I found myself walking in darkness feeling my steps and<lb facs="P35_TL00006"/>groping around, and I heard someone say, "You coward, you brute, you know<lb facs="P35_TL00007"/>why you wanted her." And from hearing this I thought to myself had she<lb facs="P35_TL00008"/>only knew the worst that was in me was that I only wanted her for pastime<lb facs="P35_TL00009"/>and an idle plaything as most men do a woman, and then again I heard<lb facs="P35_TL00010"/>someone say, "Beware, repent, or your turn- will come only worse as you<lb facs="P35_TL00011"/>know of this place." And the next thing I know, a change was coming over<lb facs="P35_TL00012"/>me. I seemed to be coming or getting back into my natural self, or surround<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P35_TL00013"/>ings, and then suddenly I found and felt myself walking on a floor and then<lb facs="P35_TL00014"/>a door opened before me and I heard someone say, "Take warning and<lb facs="P35_TL00015"/>beware of this awful place and go out and tell of your terrible experience."<lb facs="P35_TL00016"/>I went out the door and down the steps. I seemed dazed as I walked<lb facs="P35_TL00017"/>along the street for some time as if lost. I then turned and walked up another<lb facs="P35_TL00018"/>street and my clear senses seemed to be returning to me as I came to myself<lb facs="P35_TL00019"/>and looked at what street I was on, and as I walked to the corner it was just<lb facs="P35_TL00020"/>getting daylight, the dawn of a new day. It was a familiar corner I was on<lb facs="P35_TL00021"/>and while standing there I was smoking a cigarette and waiting for a street car.<lb facs="P35_TL00022"/>A car came along, I got on and came home and it was a few minutes after<lb facs="P35_TL00023"/>five in the morning that I arrived home, and to tell the truth I did feel kind of<lb facs="P35_TL00024"/>funny or weak or something on that order, and still I knew if I left this matter<lb facs="P35_TL00025"/>worry me or thought of it much that it would bring me down into a sick spell,<lb facs="P35_TL00026"/>and so I sat down in a rocking chair and started to read the paper having<lb facs="P35_TL00027"/>picked it up from the porch when I came in. I read the paper clear through,<lb facs="P35_TL00028"/>nearly everything it contained, news and advertisements.<lb facs="P35_TL00029"/>Is the sun inhabited? Yes, I believe it is, and that its inhabitants if not in<lb facs="P35_TL00030"/>the interior of it, then in its law of gravitation surrounding its atmosphere, and<lb facs="P35_TL00031"/>who are its inhabitants? I dont know, but from my experience I'll say some<lb facs="P35_TL00032"/>of us are its inhabitants, and I do know that man's laws punish us for our sins<lb facs="P35_TL00033"/>and that man gets these laws of his from the principle of nature's laws, and<lb facs="P35_TL00034"/>so it stands to reason that nature punishes us in different ways for our sins<lb facs="P35_TL00035"/>the same as man's laws.</ab>

The few simple<lb facs="P39_TL00008"/>descriptive terms which are applied to music, dealing chiefly with time, space<lb facs="P39_TL00009"/>and intensity—a theme, we say, rises or falls slowly or quickly, is played<lb facs="P39_TL00010"/>loudly or softly—intuition translates into others by association or substitution<lb facs="P39_TL00011"/>(it is not always easy to say which). Thus accentuated movement at a<lb facs="P39_TL00012"/>moderate speed may be associated with the term martial, or for the descriptive<lb facs="P39_TL00013"/>terms may be substituted the verb march; then the music is martial or marches.<lb facs="P39_TL00014"/>Further association may introduce a phrase like the pomp of power, while<lb facs="P39_TL00015"/>another substitution for the original descriptive terms may be hewn out of roclf.<lb facs="P39_TL00016"/>The way is thus opened for a wide variety of colorful descriptive phrases,<lb facs="P39_TL00017"/>intellectual meanings and even actions implying conscious volition. In fact,<lb facs="P39_TL00018"/>once the moorings are cut one may drift a considerable distance, so far even<lb facs="P39_TL00019"/>that there may be no apparent connection between the idea and the primary<lb facs="P39_TL00020"/>terms which describe the music; as when, for example, the form of a compo<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P39_TL00021"/>sition is said to be as deep as it is wide. This, however, does not overthrow<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>the idea. For the only test we have is our own intuition, which traces the<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>idea back to the primary descriptive terms. But from the fact that it dis<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

We are powerless<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>against the intuition which does perceive the connection, since by its very nature<lb facs="P39_TL00026"/>each intuition is a law unto itself.<lb facs="P39_TL00027"/>This is more obvious in the case of the emotions which music inspires, and<lb facs="P39_TL00028"/>which are often responsible for the apparently queer meanings ascribed to it.<lb facs="P39_TL00029"/>If a listener's soul insists upon soaring in ecstasy nobody can stop it; if another<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>listener becomes drowsy that is his privilege.

There is in fact room in this literary type of<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>musical criticism not only for the emotional upheavals of a Huneker, but for<lb facs="P39_TL00034"/>the blunders of a Finck or a Sanborn; the bad temper and personal animosities<lb facs="P39_TL00035"/>of a Krehbiel or a Peyser; the charlatanry of those who, without being able<lb facs="P39_TL00036"/>to appreciate music or even to hear it, apply to it the extravagant prose, the<lb facs="P39_TL00037"/>literary figures and the terms borrowed from other arts into which some critics<lb facs="P39_TL00038"/>translate it; and the will-to-interpret of Paul Rosenfeld.</ab>

Oblivious to all<lb facs="P46_TL00026"/>elements, save the natural beauty which puzzles and humors and holds him,<lb facs="P46_TL00027"/>and for which he returns the music of his words.<lb facs="P46_TL00028"/>One side of him is exotic: colors are richer, sounds are sharper in him than<lb facs="P46_TL00029"/>in other minds or in the real existence which the mass mind accepts. So that<lb facs="P46_TL00030"/>we have the poetry of sensuousness, a poetry which depends chiefly upon its<lb facs="P46_TL00031"/>exotic spirit to hold us, as in Banal Sojourn:<lb facs="P46_TL00032"/>The sky is a blue gum streaked with rose.

In the vein of The Jar Mr. Stevens strikes absolutely fresh<lb facs="P47_TL00021"/>qualities in poetry, and with the authority of a superb virtuoso. Stevens,<lb facs="P47_TL00022"/>Williams (Wm.

One more perfect thing must be<lb facs="P47_TL00024"/>quoted (The Worms at Heaven's Gate) :<lb facs="P47_TL00025"/>Out of the tomb, we bring Badroulbadour,<lb facs="P47_TL00026"/>Within our bellies, we her chariot.<lb facs="P47_TL00027"/>Here is an eye.
