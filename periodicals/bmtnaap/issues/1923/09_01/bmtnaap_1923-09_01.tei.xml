The theatre which will revive some day<lb facs="P7_TL00031"/>is as far from the cinema as poetry from music. Everything in its<lb facs="P7_TL00032"/>place, everything in its time, says the motto.

                                    <lb facs="P8_TL00003"/>Miranda slept in the orchard, lying in a long chair beneath the<lb facs="P8_TL00004"/>apple-tree. Her book had fallen into the grass, and her finger still<lb facs="P8_TL00005"/>seemed to point at the sentence "Ce pays est vraiment un des coins du<lb facs="P8_TL00006"/>monde ou le rire des filles eclate le mieux . . ." as if she had fallen<lb facs="P8_TL00007"/>asleep just there. The opals on her finger flushed green, flushed rosy,<lb facs="P8_TL00008"/>and again flushed orange as the sun, oozing through the apple-trees,<lb facs="P8_TL00009"/>filled them. Then, when the breeze blew, her purple dress rippled like<lb facs="P8_TL00010"/>a flower attached to a stalk; the grasses nodded; and the white butterfly<lb facs="P8_TL00011"/>came blowing this way and that just above her face.<lb facs="P8_TL00012"/>Four feet in the air over her head the apples hung. Suddenly there<lb facs="P8_TL00013"/>was a shrill clamour as if they were gongs of cracked brass beaten<lb facs="P8_TL00014"/>violently, irregularly, and brutally. It was only the school-children<lb facs="P8_TL00015"/>saying the multiplication table in unison, stopped by the teacher,<lb facs="P8_TL00016"/>scolded, and beginning to say the multiplication table over again. But<lb facs="P8_TL00017"/>this clamour passed four feet above Miranda's head, went through the<lb facs="P8_TL00018"/>apple boughs, and, striking against the cowman's little boy who was<lb facs="P8_TL00019"/>picking blackberries in the hedge when he should have been at school,<lb facs="P8_TL00020"/>made him tear his thumb on the thorns.<lb facs="P8_TL00021"/>Next there was a solitary cry—sad, human, brutal. Old Parsley<lb facs="P8_TL00022"/>was, indeed, blind drunk.<lb facs="P8_TL00023"/>Then the very topmost leaves of the apple-tree, flat like little fish<lb facs="P8_TL00024"/>against the blue, thirty feet above the earth, chimed with a pensive<lb facs="P8_TL00025"/>and lugubrious note. It was the organ in the church playing one of<lb facs="P8_TL00026"/>Hymns Ancient and Modern. The sound floated out and was cut<lb facs="P8_TL00027"/>into atoms by a flock of field-fares flying at an enormous speed—some<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The wind had changed.<lb facs="P8_TL00035"/>Above everything else it droned, above the woods, the meadows, the<lb facs="P8_TL00036"/>hills, miles above Miranda lying in the orchard asleep. It swept on,<lb facs="P8_TL00037"/>eyeless, brainless, meeting nothing that could stand against it, until,</ab>

Her purple dress stretched between the two apple-trees. There<lb facs="P9_TL00038"/>were twenty-four apple-trees in the orchard, some slanting slightly,<lb facs="P9_TL00039"/>others growing straight with a rush up the trunk which spread wide<lb facs="P9_TL00040"/>into branches and formed into round red or yellow drops. Each<lb facs="P9_TL00041"/>apple-tree had sufficient space. The sky exactly fitted the leaves.</ab>

On this are several<lb facs="P24_TL00010"/>half-burned candles and an oil lamp. Behind the table, an irregular<lb facs="P24_TL00011"/>piece of mirror hangs on the wall.

To the front, a<lb facs="P24_TL00013"/>second table holds a lamp and several whiskey glasses. Six rickety<lb facs="P24_TL00014"/>chairs are near this table. Two old wagon wheels rest on the floor.<lb facs="P24_TL00015"/>To the left, sitting in a high-backed chair which stands upon a low<lb facs="P24_TL00016"/>platform, the old man.

You old black fakir—<lb facs="P34_TL00014"/>Carrie K.: Brother Ralph, is that your best Amen ?<lb facs="P34_TL00015"/>She turns him to her and takes his hot cheeks in her firm cool hands.<lb facs="P34_TL00016"/>Her palms draw the fever out. With its passing, Kabnis crumples.<lb facs="P34_TL00017"/>He sinks to his knees before her, ashamed, exhausted. His eyes squeeze<lb facs="P34_TL00018"/>tight. Carrie presses his face tenderly against her. The suffocation of<lb facs="P34_TL00019"/>her fresh starched dress feels good to him. Carrie is about to lift her<lb facs="P34_TL00020"/>hands in prayer, when Halsey, at the head of the stairs, calls down.<lb facs="P34_TL00021"/>Halsey: Well, well. Whats up? Aint you ever comin?

Carrie notices<lb facs="P34_TL00026"/>his robe. She catches up to him, points to it, and helps him take it off.<lb facs="P34_TL00027"/>He hangs it, with an exaggerated ceremony, on its nail in the corner.<lb facs="P34_TL00028"/>He looks down on the tousled beds. His lips curl bitterly. Turning,<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>he stumbles over the bucket of dead coals. He savagely jerks it from<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>the floor. And then, seeing Carrie's eyes upon him, he swings the pail<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>carelessly and with eyes downcast and swollen, trudges upstairs to the<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>work-shop. Carrie's gaze follows him till he is gone. Then she goes to<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>the old man and slips to her knees before him.

The sun<lb facs="P34_TL00039"/>arises.

It is<lb facs="P61_TL00020"/>a commonplace that Mr. Fitgzerald's promise has failed to achieve<lb facs="P61_TL00021"/>an acceptable fulfillment. Therefore let the bare statement of this<lb facs="P61_TL00022"/>fact suffice. The negative feature is included in the criticism, that in<lb facs="P61_TL00023"/>this play the pest sets in before the vegetable is fairly sprouted. Jerry<lb facs="P61_TL00024"/>Frost does not come to life. The thin sophisticated disillusion of Mr.<lb facs="P61_TL00025"/>Fitzgerald begins, as it were, to eat away at his character before he<lb facs="P61_TL00026"/>is created. Hence one finds here nothing more than an attitude edited<lb facs="P61_TL00027"/>by means of a dialogue which, at least, is quite appropriate to it. This<lb facs="P61_TL00028"/>attitude doubtless springs from a recognition of the poverty of<lb facs="P61_TL00029"/>American middle-class life, of its absurd ambitions and its cheap pre<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

The Vegetable<lb facs="P61_TL00032"/>is wholly lacking in qualifying features. And since there are no flashes<lb facs="P61_TL00033"/>of prose brilliance or beauty to lift it in any way, one finds it, at best,<lb facs="P61_TL00034"/>tedious and trivial; and at its worst, vulgar.</ab>
