I had tracked Virginia Johnson across two continents<lb facs="P10_TL00009"/>till at last she was in my power, in my arms. If I tracked her down it<lb facs="P10_TL00010"/>was to kill, so that the stupid and innocent might suffer and the world<lb facs="P10_TL00011"/>be purified by pain. There is no virtue but to be intelligent. The will<lb facs="P10_TL00012"/>to die is my only justification for crime. Her eyes are looking up at<lb facs="P10_TL00013"/>me with a look which is not surely hate. And the walls fold in,<lb facs="P10_TL00014"/>suddenly, confounding us in mutual disaster. A new sun rose.<lb facs="P10_TL00015"/>I brooded for weeks over this dream, but finally I became prey<lb facs="P10_TL00016"/>to other worries. One morning on the beach I found a long spear of<lb facs="P10_TL00017"/>some heavy wood, with its point hardened in the fire. It showed no<lb facs="P10_TL00018"/>sign of having been in the water. Another day I saw a paper snake of<lb facs="P10_TL00019"/>smoke far out to sea. I lit a fire on the highest promontory and tried<lb facs="P10_TL00020"/>to signal, but the steamer, if it was a steamer, disappeared. I did not<lb facs="P10_TL00021"/>lose the hope it kindled. Months passed.<lb facs="P10_TL00022"/>I was running to the beach one early morning for my swim, when<lb facs="P10_TL00023"/>I noticed a black spot lying where the tide had washed it the night<lb facs="P10_TL00024"/>before. I rushed towards it. The spot was a woman . . . with<lb facs="P10_TL00025"/>golden hair . . . my breath hurts me . . . Virginia.<lb facs="P10_TL00026"/>I leaned over, took her wrist gently. The pulse was beating. My<lb facs="P10_TL00027"/>lips met hers in the sacrament of a first kiss.<lb facs="P10_TL00028"/>. Her eyes half opened.<lb facs="P10_TL00029"/>And in the same moment we heard the drum of an aeroplane<lb facs="P10_TL00030"/>motor overhead. We looked up. The machine was hardly a hundred<lb facs="P10_TL00031"/>yards away and on its under wing was the design of a falcon's beak.<lb facs="P10_TL00032"/>For a moment whose possibilities unfolded like paper flowers, we<lb facs="P10_TL00033"/>three: Virginia and I and the evil man above, looked one another<lb facs="P10_TL00034"/>directly in the face.<lb facs="P10_TL00035"/>The savages are approaching in their war canoes.

                                    <lb facs="P14_TL00004"/>self to sleep. An oil lamp on a chair near his elbow burns unsteadily.<lb facs="P14_TL00005"/>The cabin room is spaced fantastically about it. Whitewashed hearth<lb facs="P14_TL00006"/>and chimney, black with sooty saw-teeth. Ceiling, patterned by the<lb facs="P14_TL00007"/>fringed globe of the lamp. The walls, unpainted, are seasoned a rosin<lb facs="P14_TL00008"/>yellow. And cracks between the boards are black. These cracks are<lb facs="P14_TL00009"/>the lips the night winds use for whispering. Night winds in Georgia<lb facs="P14_TL00010"/>are vagrant poets, whispering. Kabnis, agaist his will, lets his book<lb facs="P14_TL00011"/>slip down, and listens to them. The warm whiteness of his bed, the<lb facs="P14_TL00012"/>lamp-light, do not protect him from the weird chill of their song:<lb facs="P14_TL00013"/>White -man's land.<lb facs="P14_TL00014"/>Niggers, sing.<lb facs="P14_TL00015"/>Burn, bear black children<lb facs="P14_TL00016"/>Till poor rivers bring<lb facs="P14_TL00017"/>Rest, and sweet glory<lb facs="P14_TL00018"/>In Camp Ground.<lb facs="P14_TL00019"/>Kabnis' thin hair is streaked on the pillow. His hand strokes the<lb facs="P14_TL00020"/>slim silk of his mustache. Hs thumb, pressed under his chin, seems<lb facs="P14_TL00021"/>to be trying to give squareness and projection to it. Brown eyes stare<lb facs="P14_TL00022"/>from a lemon face. Moisture gathers beneath his arm-pits. He slides<lb facs="P14_TL00023"/>down beneath the cover, seeking release.<lb facs="P14_TL00024"/>Kabnis: Near me. Now. Whoever you are, my warm glowing<lb facs="P14_TL00025"/>sweetheart, do not think that the face that rests beside you is the real<lb facs="P14_TL00026"/>Kabnis. Ralph Kabnis is a dream. And dreams are faces with large<lb facs="P14_TL00027"/>eyes and weak chins and broad brows that get smashed by the fists<lb facs="P14_TL00028"/>of square faces. The body of the world is bull-necked. A dream is<lb facs="P14_TL00029"/>a soft face that fits uncertainly upon it. . . God, if I could develop<lb facs="P14_TL00030"/>that in words. Give what I know a bull-neck and a heaving body,<lb facs="P14_TL00031"/>all would go well with me, wouldnt it, sweetheart? If I could feel<lb facs="P14_TL00032"/>that I came to the South to face it. If I, the dream (not what is<lb facs="P14_TL00033"/>weak and afraid in me) could become the face of the South. How<lb facs="P14_TL00034"/>my lips would sing for it, my songs being the lips of its soul. Soul.<lb facs="P14_TL00035"/>Soul hell. There aint no such thing. What in hell was that?<lb facs="P14_TL00036"/>A rat had run across the thin boards of the ceiling. Kabnis<lb facs="P14_TL00037"/>thrusts his head out from the covers.

What do they think<lb facs="P17_TL00021"/>this is, anyway, some sort of temperance school ? How did I ever<lb facs="P17_TL00022"/>land in such a hole? Ugh. One might just as well be in his grave.<lb facs="P17_TL00023"/>Still as a grave. Jesus, how still everything is. Does the world know<lb facs="P17_TL00024"/>how still it is? People make noise. They are afraid of silence. Of<lb facs="P17_TL00025"/>what lives, and God, of what dies in silence. There must be many<lb facs="P17_TL00026"/>dead things moving in silence. They come here to touch me. I swear<lb facs="P17_TL00027"/>I feel their fingers. . . Come, Ralph, pull yourself together. What<lb facs="P17_TL00028"/>in hell was that? Only the rustle of leaves, I guess. You know,<lb facs="P17_TL00029"/>Ralph, old man, it wouldnt surprise me at all to see a ghost. People<lb facs="P17_TL00030"/>dont think there are such things.

Anyhow, MacGraw was the first to<lb facs="P28_TL00008"/>bound on Goldfish, who could not withstand the shock and fell on<lb facs="P28_TL00009"/>his two knees. He grunted.<lb facs="P28_TL00010"/>And MacGraw strangled him with his two powerful hands, while<lb facs="P28_TL00011"/>we held the prone limbs of the painter of sanbenitos. His eyes turned<lb facs="P28_TL00012"/>slowly, his tongue pointed from his mouth, his violet-spotted face<lb facs="P28_TL00013"/>became a mask like his paintings. MacGraw, to revive his forces,<lb facs="P28_TL00014"/>untwisted his fingers and a little life seemed to reanimate the hideous<lb facs="P28_TL00015"/>patient.

A madman<lb facs="P28_TL00021"/>ran in the shelter of the walls, hunting for a little shade. He raised his<lb facs="P28_TL00022"/>arms to heaven. Out of breath he seated himself beside a dry fountain<lb facs="P28_TL00023"/>and rolled on the ground, scratching it like a wounded beast.<lb facs="P28_TL00024"/>"Perhaps the time has come for us to go," I said. MacGraw and<lb facs="P28_TL00025"/>Pitti nodded their heads, but this precipitate departure had too much<lb facs="P28_TL00026"/>the air of a flight, and we hunted for some sort of compensation.<lb facs="P28_TL00027"/>We took Goldfish, and such as he was, with his tortured face, we<lb facs="P28_TL00028"/>dressed him in a grey scapulary where unfinished demons howled before<lb facs="P28_TL00029"/>flames in the shape of tongues; we set a cardboard bonnet on his head,<lb facs="P28_TL00030"/>and it was the final brush-stroke which completed the monstrous person<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Gris, on the other hand, works with a single-minded intention<lb facs="P34_TL00029"/>which resembles the progress of a scientist more nearly than that of the<lb facs="P34_TL00030"/>traditional artist. His starting point is the relation of two or more<lb facs="P34_TL00031"/>forms. Having discovered the arrangement which best satisfies the<lb facs="P34_TL00032"/>aesthetic problem, he goes on to incarnate the forms in line or paint,<lb facs="P34_TL00033"/>regardless of visual reality. Thus, when desirable, solids mutually<lb facs="P34_TL00034"/>interpenetrate, colour is dissociated from its mass, and other liberties<lb facs="P34_TL00035"/>are taken with reality as perceived by the optic nerve. This is of course<lb facs="P34_TL00036"/>nothing new. Egyptians added the invisible eye to the profile; negroes<lb facs="P34_TL00037"/>pierced the opacity of the stomach or distorted the shape of the breast;<lb facs="P34_TL00038"/>Mayas so conventionalized the images of their gods that on first glance</ab>

                                    <lb facs="P38_TL00005"/>The Dutchman, named Janssen, led Croniamantal to the region of<lb facs="P38_TL00006"/>Aix, where there was a house which the people of the neighborhood<lb facs="P38_TL00007"/>called le Chateau. Le Chateau had nothing lordly about it other than<lb facs="P38_TL00008"/>its name and was nothing but a vast domicile containing a dairy and a<lb facs="P38_TL00009"/>stable.<lb facs="P38_TL00010"/>Mr. Janssen possessed a modest income and lived alone in this<lb facs="P38_TL00011"/>dwelling which he had bought in order to live in solitude, a suddenly<lb facs="P38_TL00012"/>broken off betrothal having rendered him rather hypochondriac. He<lb facs="P38_TL00013"/>devoted it now to the education of the son of Macaree and Vierselin<lb facs="P38_TL00014"/>Tigoboth: Croniamantal, inheritor of the old name of des Ygrees.<lb facs="P38_TL00015"/>The Dutchman, Janssen, had travelled much. He spoke all the<lb facs="P38_TL00016"/>languages of Europe, Arabian, and Turkish, not to mention Hebrew<lb facs="P38_TL00017"/>and other dead languages. His speech was as clear as his blue eyes.<lb facs="P38_TL00018"/>He soon made the friendship of several scholars of Aix whom he would<lb facs="P38_TL00019"/>visit from time to time and he corresponded with many foreign scientists.<lb facs="P38_TL00020"/>When Croniamantal was six years of age, Mr. Janssen would<lb facs="P38_TL00021"/>often take him to the country. Croniamantal came to love these lessons<lb facs="P38_TL00022"/>along the paths of wooded hills. Mr. Janssen would often stop and<lb facs="P38_TL00023"/>show Croniamantal the birds hopping about or butterflies pursuing each<lb facs="P38_TL00024"/>other and fluttering together among the wild rose-bushes. He would<lb facs="P38_TL00025"/>say that love reigned over all of Nature.

"I have always known that law, from which no human being<lb facs="P39_TL00013"/>should rebel. But there are some luckless men destined never to know<lb facs="P39_TL00014"/>the joys of love.

He also<lb facs="P39_TL00018"/>instructed the boy in Latin and Greek. They often read the Eclogues<lb facs="P39_TL00019"/>of Virgil or translated Theocritus in a clump of olive trees.

He also taught him Italian, and at an early age Croniamantal<lb facs="P39_TL00022"/>received the poems of Petrarch, who became one of his favorite poets.<lb facs="P39_TL00023"/>M. Janssen also taught Croniamantal English, and made him familiar<lb facs="P39_TL00024"/>with Shakespeare. Above all he gave the boy a taste for old French<lb facs="P39_TL00025"/>authors.

They developed in Croniamantal an<lb facs="P39_TL00030"/>invincible predilection for experiment and perilous love adventures; he<lb facs="P39_TL00031"/>devoted hmself to fencing and to horseback riding; at the age of fifteen<lb facs="P39_TL00032"/>he declared to anyone who came to visit them that he had decided to<lb facs="P39_TL00033"/>become a celebrated and peerless cavalier, and already he dreamed<lb facs="P39_TL00034"/>of a mistress.<lb facs="P39_TL00035"/>Croniamantal was, at this time, a handsome adolescent, thin and<lb facs="P39_TL00036"/>straight. The girls at the village fetes, when he touched them lightly,<lb facs="P39_TL00037"/>would stifle little bursts of laughter and redden, lowering their eyes<lb facs="P39_TL00038"/>under his regard. Habituated to poetic forms, his mind thought of<lb facs="P39_TL00039"/>love as a conquest. Thoughts of Boccacio, his natural daring, his<lb facs="P39_TL00040"/>education, everything disposed him to take the final step.<lb facs="P39_TL00041"/>One May day, he went out for a long ride.

The road menders, handsome boys in<lb facs="P40_TL00006"/>bright colored caps, worked lazily, singing the while, and stopping<lb facs="P40_TL00007"/>occasionally to drink from their flasks.

He arrived<lb facs="P40_TL00014"/>close to a little bridge thrown across a river which cut the road. The<lb facs="P40_TL00015"/>place was isolated, and across the hedges and the trunks of poplars, he<lb facs="P40_TL00016"/>saw two beautiful girls bathing, quite naked. One was in the water<lb facs="P40_TL00017"/>and held herself up by a branch. He admired her brown arms and<lb facs="P40_TL00018"/>abundant beauties, hardly concealed by the water. The other, standing<lb facs="P40_TL00019"/>on the bank, dried herself after her bath and exposed ravishing lines<lb facs="P40_TL00020"/>and graces which enflamed the heart of Croniamantal; he decided to<lb facs="P40_TL00021"/>join them and mingle in their pleasures. Unluckily, he perceived in<lb facs="P40_TL00022"/>the branches of a neighboring tree two youths spying on this prey.<lb facs="P40_TL00023"/>Holding their breath and watching the least movements of the bathers,<lb facs="P40_TL00024"/>they did not see the equestrian, who, laughing uproariously, threw his<lb facs="P40_TL00025"/>horse into a gallop and cried aloud as he crossed the little bridge.<lb facs="P40_TL00026"/>The sun had risen almost to its zenith and was now darting its<lb facs="P40_TL00027"/>dreadful rays. An ardent thirst added itself to the amorous inquietudes<lb facs="P40_TL00028"/>of Croniamantal. The sight of a farm along the road brought him<lb facs="P40_TL00029"/>unspeakable joy. He arrived at a little orchard whose blossoming<lb facs="P40_TL00030"/>trees made a lovely sight. It was a little wood, rose and white with<lb facs="P40_TL00031"/>the cherry and peach blossoms. On the fence linen was drying and<lb facs="P40_TL00032"/>he had the pleasure of seeing a charming peasant girl of about sixteen,<lb facs="P40_TL00033"/>at work washing clothes in a vat in the shadow of a fig-tree that had<lb facs="P40_TL00034"/>just begun to bloom. Not having noticed his arrival, she continued<lb facs="P40_TL00035"/>to accomplish her domestic function which he found noble; for, his<lb facs="P40_TL00036"/>imagination full of memories of antiquity, he compared her to Nausica.<lb facs="P40_TL00037"/>Descending from his horse he approached and contemplated the young<lb facs="P40_TL00038"/>girl with ravishment. He looked at her back. Her folded up skirt<lb facs="P40_TL00039"/>discovered a well made leg in a very white stocking.

                                    <lb facs="P41_TL00002"/>I have always loved beautiful arms especially. There are people<lb facs="P41_TL00003"/>who attach great importance to the perfection of the foot. I admit<lb facs="P41_TL00004"/>that they touch me too, but the arm is to my mind that which should<lb facs="P41_TL00005"/>be most perfect in woman. It is always in motion, one always has one's<lb facs="P41_TL00006"/>eye upon it. One might say that it is the veritable organ of the graces,<lb facs="P41_TL00007"/>and that by its deft movements, it is the veritable arm of Love, since<lb facs="P41_TL00008"/>when curved, this delicate arm resembles a bow, and when extended,<lb facs="P41_TL00009"/>the arrow thereof.<lb facs="P41_TL00010"/>This was also Croniamantal's point of view. He was thinking<lb facs="P41_TL00011"/>of this, when suddenly, his horse, who suddenly remembered that it<lb facs="P41_TL00012"/>was the habitual hour for being fed began to whinny. At once the<lb facs="P41_TL00013"/>young girl turned and showed surprise at seeing a stranger regarding<lb facs="P41_TL00014"/>her from above the fence. She blushed and only seemed the more<lb facs="P41_TL00015"/>charming. Her dusky skin attested to the Moorish blood that flowed<lb facs="P41_TL00016"/>in her veins. Croniamantal asked her for food and drink. With<lb facs="P41_TL00017"/>much good grace this sweet girl did have him enter the house and served<lb facs="P41_TL00018"/>him a rude repast. some milk, eggs and black bread, his thirst<lb facs="P41_TL00019"/>and his hunger were soon sated. In the meantime, he questioned<lb facs="P41_TL00020"/>his young hostess, in the hope of finding an opportunity for paying her<lb facs="P41_TL00021"/>gallant compliments. He learned that her name was Mariette, and<lb facs="P41_TL00022"/>that her parents had gone to the neighboring town to sell vegetables;<lb facs="P41_TL00023"/>her brother was working on the road. This family lived happily on<lb facs="P41_TL00024"/>the products of the orchard and the barnyard.<lb facs="P41_TL00025"/>At this moment, her parents, fine looking peasants, returned, and<lb facs="P41_TL00026"/>there was Croniamantal already in love with Mariette, quite dis<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>
                                    <lb facs="P41_TL00027"/>appointed. He paid the mother for the meal, and went off, after having<lb facs="P41_TL00028"/>given Mariette a long look which she did not return, but he had the<lb facs="P41_TL00029"/>satisfaction of seeing her blush as she turned away.<lb facs="P41_TL00030"/>He mounted his horse and took the road to his house. Being for<lb facs="P41_TL00031"/>the first time in his life, sad for love, he found extreme melancholy in<lb facs="P41_TL00032"/>this same countryside which he had previously traversed. The sun<lb facs="P41_TL00033"/>had dropped low over the horizon. The grey leaves of the olive trees<lb facs="P41_TL00034"/>seemed as sad as himself. The shadows stretched out like waves. The<lb facs="P41_TL00035"/>river where he had seen the bathers was abandoned. The lapping of<lb facs="P41_TL00036"/>the water became unbearable for him, like a mockery. He threw his<lb facs="P41_TL00037"/>horse into a gallop. Then there was the dusk, lights appearing in the<lb facs="P41_TL00038"/>distance. Then night came; he slowed up his horse and abandoned<lb facs="P41_TL00039"/>himself to a disordered revery. The sloping road was bordered with<lb facs="P41_TL00040"/>cypresses, and it was thus, somnolent with the night and with love, that<lb facs="P41_TL00041"/>Croniamantal pursued his melancholy way.</ab>

But in the studio there were joys<lb facs="P43_TL00027"/>of all colours. A great window opened the whole north side and nothing<lb facs="P43_TL00028"/>could be seen but the whole blue sky, the song of a woman. Cronia<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Dressed in a blue wrap, barefooted,<lb facs="P43_TL00032"/>the painter also regarded the picture in which two women remembered<lb facs="P43_TL00033"/>themselves in a glacial mist.<lb facs="P43_TL00034"/>The studio contained another fatal object, a large piece of broken<lb facs="P43_TL00035"/>mirror hooked to the wall. It was a dead and soundless sea, standing<lb facs="P43_TL00036"/>on end, and at the bottom of which a false life animated what did not<lb facs="P43_TL00037"/>exist. Thus, confronting Art, there is the appearance of Art, against<lb facs="P43_TL00038"/>which men are not sufficiently on their guard, and which pulls them to<lb facs="P43_TL00039"/>earth when Art has raised them to the heights.

                                       <lb facs="P49_TL00012"/>sults are rather slight and somewhat artificial, for such devices can be<lb facs="P49_TL00013"/>nothing more than anemic substitutes for the natural depth and drive<lb facs="P49_TL00014"/>of generative ideas and essentialized design.<lb facs="P49_TL00015"/>In the first story, a portrait doll of Captain Hepburn, made by his<lb facs="P49_TL00016"/>mistress, is dangled about until it is finally forced to serve as starting<lb facs="P49_TL00017"/>point for the following observation:<lb facs="P49_TL00018"/>"And you can say what you like, but arty woman, today, no matter<lb facs="P49_TL00019"/>how much she loves her man‚Äîshe could start any minute and make<lb facs="P49_TL00020"/>a doll of him. And the doll would be her hero: and her hero would<lb facs="P49_TL00021"/>be no more than her doll."<lb facs="P49_TL00022"/>Which is the climax of this episode. The fox is more effectively an<lb facs="P49_TL00023"/>instrument of the second narrative. For the effect it has upon the girl<lb facs="P49_TL00024"/>Ellen, and the compelling fascination which Henry Grenfel exercises<lb facs="P49_TL00025"/>over her are similar and interchangeable. But the importance and<lb facs="P49_TL00026"/>function of the ladybird, aside from certain irrelevant comments made<lb facs="P49_TL00027"/>concerning it and the fact that it is a descendant of the Egyptian<lb facs="P49_TL00028"/>scarabeus, are questionable, trivial.<lb facs="P49_TL00029"/>(2) A descriptive faculty that tends to overshadow or ignore the<lb facs="P49_TL00030"/>essential progression of the characters.

Maladjustment and friction<lb facs="P54_TL00013"/>comes when one life tries to penetrate the domain of the other. The<lb facs="P54_TL00014"/>spiritual obtuseness of Mayne is pricked by his love for, and marriage<lb facs="P54_TL00015"/>to Lilian. Distemper and disease set in, and he finally dies at the<lb facs="P54_TL00016"/>home of the Orissers. Standish, forced to endure this place because<lb facs="P54_TL00017"/>of the sickness of his friend, escapes to his own sphere immediately<lb facs="P54_TL00018"/>after the death of this latter. Lilian's spiritual decay is hastened by<lb facs="P54_TL00019"/>the invasion. And Nicholas salvages nothing but bitterness from his<lb facs="P54_TL00020"/>contact with the material world. Two other major characters figure<lb facs="P54_TL00021"/>in this work: Cosmo Orisser and Allen. Cosmo, in addition to the<lb facs="P54_TL00022"/>spiritual values of the Orissers, is possessed by a vehement temperament<lb facs="P54_TL00023"/>that drives him into experience. Lacking direction, his fervor for a<lb facs="P54_TL00024"/>more perfect world degenerates to a hate that includes the place that<lb facs="P54_TL00025"/>cradled him and the social form that could find no function for his<lb facs="P54_TL00026"/>vision. His end is in near-insanity and complete frustration. Allen,<lb facs="P54_TL00027"/>by virtue of an interest in archeology and a less rigid and passionate<lb facs="P54_TL00028"/>nature, manages to straddle the two mutually exclusive worlds.<lb facs="P54_TL00029"/>The analysis is thorough and convincing, though it is not complete.<lb facs="P54_TL00030"/>Summarized, it might be stated thus: since power resides with<lb facs="P54_TL00031"/>the complacent, conformist materialists, those who possess dissenting<lb facs="P54_TL00032"/>spiritual values will abort (suffering in proporton to the passion with<lb facs="P54_TL00033"/>which they press their convictions) or be snowed under. And since<lb facs="P54_TL00034"/>an acceptable mixture is impossible, the commercial-financial class will<lb facs="P54_TL00035"/>over-ride and supplant the old landowners. As a limited cross-section<lb facs="P54_TL00036"/>of western experience‚Äîthat is, in this novel, one accepts these conclu<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Here, surely, whatever the content of the coming years, it is<lb facs="P54_TL00038"/>not for Lilian or Nicholas; it is for Walter Standish. But as a<lb facs="P54_TL00039"/>general concept and interpretation, this view likewise is not complete.<lb facs="P54_TL00040"/>For it ignores the possible proletarian influence upon both of these<lb facs="P54_TL00041"/>classes. And it excludes the fact and force of creative values coupled<lb facs="P54_TL00042"/>with direction. It excludes the creator, strong enough to accept rather<lb facs="P54_TL00043"/>than reject.

The prose is fresh and easy-flowing. And a music<lb facs="P55_TL00016"/>comes into it by way of lovely Irish names and the peculiar Irish-<lb facs="P55_TL00017"/>English dialog. Nor, given the peasant rhythm, can one seriously<lb facs="P55_TL00018"/>object to the book's slow movement, or to the somewhat episodic way<lb facs="P55_TL00019"/>in which it unfolds. What, then, is wrong? This: for some reason,<lb facs="P55_TL00020"/>perhaps because Mr. Colum has placed too much reliance upon his<lb facs="P55_TL00021"/>content, upon its inherent soil-ness and lyricism, upon the general<lb facs="P55_TL00022"/>interest in Ireland's struggle for political autonomy, because he has<lb facs="P55_TL00023"/>given himself too sparingly unto his work, the poetry of the material<lb facs="P55_TL00024"/>and the poetry of the prose fail to achieve a mutually transforming<lb facs="P55_TL00025"/>contact.

(One's standards tend to be exacting of<lb facs="P55_TL00027"/>the literature that produced John M. Synge.)

The chronicle of Broom's vicissitudes among the nations<lb facs="P57_TL00010"/>would be of interest, but it is not so important as an account of the<lb facs="P57_TL00011"/>internal evolution of its editorial policy.<lb facs="P57_TL00012"/>Whenever a producer in America is censured for the cheapness,<lb facs="P57_TL00013"/>triviality or vulgarity of the creation he sponsors, he shrugs the respon<pc type="endhypen" pre="false">-</pc>

Such an abstraction as "the public" is of course fallacious,<lb facs="P57_TL00016"/>there being many publics and more potential ones. The inception of<lb facs="P57_TL00017"/>BROOM was based on the faith that there is a public which wants to<lb facs="P57_TL00018"/>read sincere contemporary work, regardless of whether or not it has<lb facs="P57_TL00019"/>been prepared by advance publicity, regardless of the difficulty in<lb facs="P57_TL00020"/>understanding writing which follows experimental and novel modes.<lb facs="P57_TL00021"/>The first problem of BROOM was to find this public. Since it lacked<lb facs="P57_TL00022"/>the means to attempt the usual publicity, it had to invent other methods.<lb facs="P57_TL00023"/>Printing in Europe was the first stratagem. Owing to valuta, it was<lb facs="P57_TL00024"/>possible to provide an exotic luxury in make-up, which attracted many<lb facs="P57_TL00025"/>readers who otherwise would have failed to single it out from the scores<lb facs="P57_TL00026"/>of literary periodicals that spring up and pass away with the seasons.<lb facs="P57_TL00027"/>Also, the unusualness of an American magazine which proclaimed the<lb facs="P57_TL00028"/>Eternal City as its home aroused a curiosity among readers which was<lb facs="P57_TL00029"/>increased by the nature of the material it published. A small and<lb facs="P57_TL00030"/>reliable public was soon accumulated.<lb facs="P57_TL00031"/>The second problem of Broom proved more difficult of solution.<lb facs="P57_TL00032"/>To find little-known writers worth printing and unrecognized artists<lb facs="P57_TL00033"/>worth reproducing has taken many months of hard work.

Certain novelists became prominent<lb facs="P58_TL00022"/>whose chief tenet was the evil underlying the showy phenomena of our<lb facs="P58_TL00023"/>life. It is not necessary to follow the trend from Upton Sinclair and<lb facs="P58_TL00024"/>Dreiser to Anderson and Lewis; their point of attack shifts but the<lb facs="P58_TL00025"/>essence of their work is similar.

His stories, which discard<lb facs="P59_TL00032"/>the old binding of plot or narrative, obtain unity by what he calls a<lb facs="P59_TL00033"/>super-plot: "the structural framework which appeals to us over and<lb facs="P59_TL00034"/>above the message of the line," or paragraph.<lb facs="P59_TL00035"/>The experiments of Malcolm Cowley are even more diversified.<lb facs="P59_TL00036"/>He believes that every literary conception has an ideal form.

Hart Crane must also be<lb facs="P60_TL00012"/>mentioned in this connection. E. E. Cummings, the most inventive of<lb facs="P60_TL00013"/>all these experimenters, is somewhat older and already well known.<lb facs="P60_TL00014"/>The list can be continued farther. Slater Brown, Robert Coates, John<lb facs="P60_TL00015"/>Crawford, Charles Galwey, Jean Toomer, Glenway Wescott, Yvor<lb facs="P60_TL00016"/>Winters and several others are working along lines of equal interest,<lb facs="P60_TL00017"/>but it is premature to appraise or even define them, since the only<lb facs="P60_TL00018"/>quality they unquestionably share is that their best work is still to be<lb facs="P60_TL00019"/>done.

Such work is seldom the best work, although it has<lb facs="P60_TL00023"/>greater commercial value. Material of this kind seldom finds its way<lb facs="P60_TL00024"/>into BROOM, which rather errs in the other direction, and is more apt<lb facs="P60_TL00025"/>to accept work not quite mature. Thus the readers of Broom are in a<lb facs="P60_TL00026"/>sense gamblers, like prospectors for oil. The reward is of a different<lb facs="P60_TL00027"/>kind, but so is the cost.<lb facs="P60_TL00028"/>BROOM is able at last to give up its vagabond career and to settle<lb facs="P60_TL00029"/>in the country to which it belongs. Its collaborators have slowly drawn<lb facs="P60_TL00030"/>together into an effective and unified working force.
